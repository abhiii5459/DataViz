            <p>[Setting: Bookstore]</p>
            <p>(George and Jerry both enter a bookstore)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet 
              girls in New York.</p>
            <p>JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now 
              the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' 
              anybody.</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks up to Jerry and George while leafing through a book)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over 
              to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcastic) You better hurry.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I'm gonna hit the head.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. 
              See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker 
              vehicles.</p>
            <p>(George is about to go into the bathroom. He grabs a book on his 
              way in)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.</p>
            <p>JERRY: She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the 
              one she danced at last year?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh? Who's Leo?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Uncle Leo.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..</p>
            <p>(Kramer and Jerry both watch Leo looking at the books on a shelf. 
              Then, Leo takes a book and puts it under his coat)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Did I just see that?!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, 
              huh?</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: The Annual Peterman Party]</p>
            <p>(Elaine is sitting alone at a table. Walter, a co-worker, comes 
              up to her)</p>
            <p>WALTER: (Joking around with her) So, Elaine.. are you going to 
              dance this year?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Maybe.. All over your face!</p>
            <p>(A waiter serving food approaches Elaine)</p>
            <p>WAITER: If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be 
              brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.</p>
            <p>(Elaine is looking both angry and embarrassed. Scene cuts to Peterman 
              giving a toast)</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians 
              of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and 
              popping sounds. The music</p>
            <p>starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that 
              they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things 
              started. (Grabs a female</p>
            <p>employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts back to Elaine's table. A fellow employee sits down 
              at Elaine's table)</p>
            <p>ZACH: Hi, I'm Zach.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Bookstore]</p>
            <p>(George casually puts the large book he took into the bathroom 
              with him on the shelf. A manager notices, and approaches him)</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Acting innocent) I'm all set.</p>
            <p>MANAGER: (Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to 
              hear?</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: The Coffee shop]</p>
            <p>(George and Jerry are at Monk's Coffee shop)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. 
              (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it 
              wasn't for the toilet, there</p>
            <p>would be no books.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend 
              a lot of time in there.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded 
              by reading material. It's entrapment!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 
              'French Impressionist Paintings'?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Cutting him off) Thank you very much.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when 
              there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at 
              the bookstore.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to 
              the man!</p>
            <p>(Elaine enters and sits down)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Sleeping in the caragain?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Cocktail flu.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. 
              There was this guy, and we had a few too many..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You went home with him?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going 
              down!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. 
              Did you end up xeroxing anything?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this 
              is to someone in my position?</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Confused) What's your position?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I am an associate.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Hey, me too.</p>
            <p>(A waitress, passing their table, speaks up)</p>
            <p>WAITRESS: Yeah, me too.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what 
              everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of 
              Skanko-Roman wrestling.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Jerry's apartment]</p>
            <p>(Jerry enters his apartment to find Newman and Kramer having a 
              conference at his table)</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and 
              sandwiches?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: (Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you 
              can clear some of this stuff out of the way.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the 
              table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're 
              gonna make it happen!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yes, it can.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, 
              we're gonna have a whole fleet!</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt 
              or dander of the equine.</p>
            <p>JERRY: So, who's gonna pull this thing?</p>
            <p>(Kramer and Newman both look at eachother)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Yeah, but I though-</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, 
              isn't this an awkward moment?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Brainstorming) What about the homeless?</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Can't we worry about them later?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: (Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate 
              knowledge of the street..</p>
            <p>KRAMER: They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap 
              something to them?!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard 
              all day.</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: The Coffee shop]</p>
            <p>(Uncle Leo enters, and joins Jerry at his booth)</p>
            <p>LEO: Jerry, hello! (Sits down)</p>
            <p>JERRY: So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?</p>
            <p>LEO: I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about 
              money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?</p>
            <p>LEO: What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly 
              amending what he just said) But I'm not.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.</p>
            <p>LEO: Why didn't ya say hello?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book.</p>
            <p>LEO: (Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.</p>
            <p>LEO: Oh, they don't care. We all do it.</p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>JERRY: Who, criminals?</p>
            <p>LEO: Senior citizens. No big deal.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You could get arrested.</p>
            <p>LEO: Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his 
              stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. 
              What's my name? Will you take me</p>
            <p>home?</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Pleading) Leo..</p>
            <p>LEO: Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.</p>
            <p>LEO: (Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody 
              answer that damn phone?!</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Peterman office building hallway]</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been 
              dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?</p>
            <p>WALTER: Well..</p>
            <p>ELAINE: &quot;Well&quot;? We've been dating for three months. Between 
              you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.</p>
            <p>(Elaine enters into the break room. There, she sees Zach making 
              out with another co-worker)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..</p>
            <p>WALTER: (Pointing at the closed door) Isn't that Zach?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Yeah.</p>
            <p>WALTER: Aren't you upset?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!</p>

            <p>[Setting: NYC street]</p>
            <p>(Kramer and Newman are standing there with a rickshaw. Close by 
              are three homeless guys in a line)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked 
              out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for 
              are motivated,</p>
            <p>hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. 
              (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, 
              I don't caer where you're</p>

            <p>KRAMER: (Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws 
              means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned 
              upper body.</p>
            <p>(Kramer looks at the two confused guys) Or a shirt..</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Alright, who's first?</p>

              on the shoulder - dust flies into the air)</p>

            <p>NEWMAN: Name, please.</p>
            <p>HOMELESS MAN: Rusty.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: (Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No 
              offence.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: (To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the 
              block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what 
              you've got! Ok? Ready, and</p>
            <p>go!</p>
            <p>(Rusty takes off down the street with the rickshaw)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good 
              form.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: (Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're 
              gonna have to do this all day for very little money.</p>
            <p>(They both notice that Rusty is not stopping)</p>

              the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes 
              a noise), he bolted.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all 
              homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from 
              him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters.

              here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I could take it in merchandise..</p>
            <p>REBECCA: (Threatening to hit him) Here I come..</p>

            <p>[Setting: Bookstore]</p>
            <p>(Elaine and Jerry are both at the bookstore. Elaine is talking 
              with the cashier while checking out a book)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?</p>
            <p>CASHIER: Yeah.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Great.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (To Elaine) So, the worst is over?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm 
              the office hero.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real 
              ones.</p>
            <p>ELAIEN: Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.</p>
            <p>(She's through buying the book, and is ready to go)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Leaving Jerry) See ya.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.</p>

            <p>[Setting: NYC Street]</p>
            <p>(Newman is being pulled up a steep hill on the rickshaw by Kramer)</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets 
              the rickshaw down - taking a rest)</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Stretching) Oh..</p>
            <p>(The rickshaw starts to roll back down the hill)</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: (Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!</p>
            <p>(The rickshaw starts to rapidly go down the street. Kramer makes 
              an attempt to chase it)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Woah! Wait!</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to Zach. he's walking out into the street)</p>
            <p>ZACH: (Optimistic) Well, this is the first day of the rest of my 
              life!</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts back to Newman - still rolling down the hill)</p>
            <p>NEWMAN: Waaaaahhhh!</p>
            <p>(Zach and the rickshaw collide. From back up on top of the street, 
              Kramer tries to separate himself from the accident. He starts walking, 
              then running away from the</p>
            <p>crushed rickshaw)</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Bookstore]</p>
            <p>(Jerry is in Brentano's - waiting for the manager. He sees George 
              enter)</p>
            <p>JERRY: George? What are you doin' here?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I can't sell the book. It's been marked.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That 
              way, everything is even.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal 
              another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I'm goin' in!</p>
            <p>(George walks off to steal one of the books. The manager walks 
              up to Jerry)</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Did you want to speak with the manager?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy 
              is we prosecute all shoplifters.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All 
              old people steal.</p>
            <p>MANAGER: That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. 
              Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft 
              lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.</p>
            <p>JERRY: So it could be anyone?</p>
            <p>MANAGER: I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.</p>
            <p>(Jerry turns to George. George has a huge bundle under his overcoat 
              - and is trying to act innocent)</p>
            <p>JERRY: That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!</p>
            <p>(George is instantly surrounded by guards)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: No! Jerry!</p>
