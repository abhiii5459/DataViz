              Ivy (see below)<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, [tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done]: 
              &quot;Any<br>
              second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [appearing in the kitchen stark naked]: &quot;Oh, fantastic! 
              I'm<br>
              starving.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [looking at her]: &quot;How about that.&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [eating the waffles]: &quot;Mmm-hmm.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              George: &quot;She ate breakfast naked?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;She didn't even want a napkin.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom 
              naked... I<br>
              have never had living-room naked.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, it's a scene.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did 
              she, uh, did she<br>
              frolic?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I don't really have enough room.&quot;<br>
              George, [seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's]: &quot;Yeah. 
              Hey, Lainie,<br>
              Puddy.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey!&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Hi.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Puddy, [heading towards the bathroom]: &quot;I got to make a pit 
              stop.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, [sitting down in the booth]: &quot;'Kay.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Back together?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd 
              give it<br>
              another shot.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Ah...&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;He called to apologize for standing me up five years 
              ago.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Why now?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine 
              is you have to<br>
              apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling 
              back to me.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Still with the neck hole?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Still upset. Very upset.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What neck hole?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years 
              ago? He had that<br>
              very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, becoming board: &quot;Faster.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I asked if I could borrow a sweater.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;A cashmere sweater.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front 
              of the whole<br>
              party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or 
              is it 'cause of<br>
              your neck?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, I think the head does most of the stretching.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the 
              party in some<br>
              cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I really think it's the size of your neck.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;It's my head!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Peggy: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, 
              you and I<br>
              are the only ones who use this bathroom.&quot;<br>
              Peggy, somewhat sarcastically: &quot;Yeah. Great.&quot;<br>
              [Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the toilet]<br>
              <br>
              Kramer: &quot;You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, 
              I just wanted to<br>
              hop in the shower.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Showering. How long does it take you?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Ten minutes.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, [seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment]: &quot;Ten minutes? 
              That's<br>
              kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Ten minutes.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Let me smell you.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;All right. Whiff away.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, [after delicately sniffing Elaine]: &quot;Uh... that's not 
              bad at all.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, [holding Kramer off from getting another whiff]: &quot;Hup! 
              That's it.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, [backing off]: &quot;OK.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and 
              I see Peggy<br>
              using a seat protector.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're 
              like<br>
              roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over]: 
              &quot;I<br>
              think the damage is probably already done.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the 
              soda]: &quot;All<br>
              right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, [eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda]: &quot;Yeah, 
              you're<br>
              probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Mmm.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some 
              changes. Get<br>
              wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- 
              focus!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, [playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend]: &quot;Zephyr? 
              That is not a<br>
              word.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;Do you challenge?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, I do not challenge.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;66 points. Ha ha.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where 
              you'd hide the<br>
              tiles.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;You want some more ice tea?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Sure.&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [coughing loudly, while Jerry's expression turns to disgust]: 
              &quot;Wrong<br>
              pipe.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, [at Monk's with Jerry]: &quot;So she coughed.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Everything goes with naked.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles 
              that suddenly<br>
              spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball 
              in his<br>
              stomach in slow motion.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much 
              mental energy I<br>
              expend just trying to picture women naked?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;But the thing you don't realize is that there's good 
              naked and bad<br>
              naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's 
              Hanke.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;All right. It's grovel time.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've 
              been going<br>
              through the Twelve Steps.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Yeah. Making amends.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Important step. Maybe the most important.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, 
              you know, when<br>
              we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even 
              have<br>
              called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, 
              but I<br>
              always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying 
              it.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: [eyeing George, who's looking expectedly up at him]: &quot;Great. 
              Great.<br>
              Well, I'll see you guys later.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, [entering Jerry's apartment]: &quot;Well, I just got out 
              of a 27-minute<br>
              shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. 
              Yeah, I<br>
              think what I kept is even stronger now.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [pointing to Kramer's hair]: &quot;You got some suds over 
              here.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Kramer, [noticing suds all over his clothes and body]: &quot;Wha...? 
              Oh, man!<br>
              Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what 
              I'm doing<br>
              wrong.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You promise you'll never come in here again?&quot;<br>
              Kramer, [chuckling]: &quot;Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, [standing in the bathtub]: &quot;Now my sense of it is that 
              you're probably<br>
              wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, that's how cats do it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you 
              want to use<br>
              gravity.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;OK. Let's turn the water on now. &quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, I told you, it's just a dry run.&quot;<br>
              George, [entering Jerry's bathroom]: &quot;Well, Hanke's moved on 
              to Step Ten. He<br>
              was spotted taking personal inventory.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That's Step Ten?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a 
              prayer, and he's<br>
              done. Do you believe this?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, this has all been one big tease!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, [moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk]: 
              &quot;These<br>
              proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this 
              will work.&quot;<br>
              Peggy, [having seen Elaine touch her nearly full water bottle]: 
              &quot;I'm... gonna<br>
              get another bottle of water.&quot;<br>
              Walter,[ taking a final swig from his own water bottle]: &quot;Here, 
              take mine.<br>
              There's a little left.&quot;<br>
              Peggy, [gulping down Walter's water]: &quot;Oh, thanks, Walter. 
              Ahh!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Hanke, [talking with two men in Monk's]: &quot;Guys, there's no 
              doubt that the pay<br>
              is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice 
              cream.&quot;<br>
              Man #1: &quot;You get pretty buff forearms.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;I don't know if I'm into that.&quot;<br>
              George, [entering Monk's]: &quot;Oh, hello, Hanke, others.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;George.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... 
              I didn't get my<br>
              apology.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Apology? For what?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game 
              giveaway<br>
              Metlife windbreaker?&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;George, come on, not that neck hole thing.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate 
              it if you would<br>
              say you're sorry.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;No way, you would've completely stretched it out.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! 
              Step Nine.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, 
              very sorry. I'm so<br>
              sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to 
              find its way<br>
              through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, [taking notes on showering men at the YMCA]: &quot;Now see, 
              that's smart.<br>
              Constant motion. Wow.&quot;<br>
              Man in Shower, [seeing Kramer staring at the showering man]: &quot;Hey!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this 
              guy's really<br>
              showing me something!&quot;<br>
              Kramer, [walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye]: 
              &quot;You got a<br>
              steak?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Ah, people in this city are crazy.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [giving him a steak from the fridge]: &quot;Here ya go.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, [applying the steak to his eye]: &quot;Thanks, buddy. Oh... 
              yes! Hey, you<br>
              got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, a different one.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [closing the door on him]: &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Jerry!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Melissa, [wheeling out Jerry's bicycle]: &quot;OK, Jerry. I fixed 
              that bike.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. 
              It's just for<br>
              show.&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [crouching down next to the bike]: &quot;I should really 
              clean those<br>
              bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Please don't crouch.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;Ouch! Caught my skin.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;You got anything to snack on?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Uhh...&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [grabbing the pickle jar and straining to open it]: &quot;Oh, 
              pickles!<br>
              Unnhhhh! It's a tough one.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [finally opening the jar]: &quot;Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna 
              leave a welt.<br>
              Look at that.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [leaving the room]: &quot;I can't. I can't look anymore. 
              I-I-I've seen too<br>
              much.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine: &quot;Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that 
              you find so<br>
              offensive?&quot;<br>
              Peggy: &quot;You seem to be with a lot of men.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You 
              know, I mean,<br>
              we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here 
              or... or<br>
              there, but, wh-why is this your business?&quot;<br>
              Peggy: &quot;It's not. Good day.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, [leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her 
              butt,<br>
              sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob]: 
              &quot;Oh. All<br>
              right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about 
              some for<br>
              your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? 
              That's good,<br>
              isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry: &quot;Well, technically he did apologize.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible 
              sketch. He was<br>
              riffing! Riffing! On my pain!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the 
              original<br>
              apology?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;That's right. I'm two in the hole!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She 
              did a full body<br>
              flex on a pickle jar.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Did you explain to her about the good naked and the 
              bad naked?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You 
              still got that<br>
              belt sander?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              George, [going into the bathroom]: &quot;Well, you on all fours, 
              that thing<br>
              vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [answering the ringing phone]: &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;World War I plane?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to 
              get out of the<br>
              shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where 
              I want to<br>
              be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and 
              now I<br>
              ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;When are ya gettin' out?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Peterman: &quot;Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, please.&quot;<br>
              Peterman: &quot;She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense 
              malaise.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?&quot;<br>
              Peterman: &quot;I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her 
              mind, OK? She is<br>
              insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, 
              rubbed<br>
              her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, 
              she's a<br>
              wacko.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, [at Monk's]: &quot;So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;Sponsor.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you 
              can go through<br>
              them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead 
              of an<br>
              apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;I'm not sure what you want me to do.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let 
              him move up!<br>
              When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three 
              years 'cause<br>
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;You're quite upset, George.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;Admit there's a higher power?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.&quot;<br>
              Sponer: &quot;You know George, I think I can help you. We're having 
              a meeting<br>
              tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much.&quot;<br>
              George, [giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench]: &quot;By 
              the way, my<br>
              uncle was an alcoholic, so...&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, [on the phone in the shower]: &quot;Lomez, you're not listenin'. 
              Jerry<br>
              likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. 
              Calm<br>
              down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, 
              I'll call<br>
              ya back.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Melissa, [naked on the couch]: &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [naked, carrying a belt sander]: &quot;I found a rough spot 
              on the kitchen<br>
              floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;No, not that. Why are you naked?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I thought naked is good.&quot;<br>
              Melissa, [eyeing him]: &quot;This isn't good naked.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Sponsor, [seeing George at the meeting]: &quot;George, here, have 
              a seat.&quot;<br>
              George, [sitting down]: &quot;Where's Hanke?&quot;<br>
              Sponsor, [motioning to the leader]: &quot;Shhhhh.&quot;<br>
              Leader: &quot;OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What? Rate-aholics?&quot;<br>
              Sponsor: &quot;George, this can help you.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.&quot;<br>
              Leader: &quot;Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these 
              meetings.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!&quot;<br>
              Leader: &quot;Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I'm losin' it!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, [in Monk's with George]: &quot;He took you to Rage-aholics? 
              Why?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Probably because this whole Universe is against me!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You've got a little rage.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes 
              me so mad!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;This bread has nuts in it!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, [seeing Elaine enter Monk's]: &quot;Oh, great. Elaine. What 
              is wrong with<br>
              my body?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Chicken wing shoulder blades.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That's it?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;No, but that's one problem. Why?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa 
              the other day--&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good 
              look for a<br>
              man.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Why not? It's a good look for a woman.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male 
              body is<br>
              utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So you don't think it's attractive?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's 
              simian.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, some women like it.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hmm. Sickies.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, [in the shower, reading an instruction manual]: &quot;Installing 
              your<br>
              Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage 
              lot.<br>
              Oh, come on, Clarkman.&quot;<br>
              Puddy, [staring into space, picks up the phone]: &quot;Puddy.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Is, uh, David Puddy there?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;This is Puddy.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, this is Kramer.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;I know.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install 
              a garbage<br>
              disposal?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch 
              hasp from the<br>
              auxiliary drainage line.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No. It says 'main line'.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Puddy, seeing Elaine come in: &quot;Hey, man, I'll call you back. 
              I'll talk you<br>
              through it.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey, Puddy.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for 
              a balloon<br>
              bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when 
              you see him.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Balloon bouquet? For who?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Peggy took a turn for the worst.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;That's what he said.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I don't believe this woman.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Talk to me, Babe.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs 
              make her sick.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
              Puddy, showing her his necklace: &quot;I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. 
              Ten years.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What is this symbol?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;It's a germ.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Peggy: &quot;Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're 
              currently<br>
              sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have 
              any problem<br>
              with germs.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Don't you? Elaine.&quot;<br>
              [Elaine slowly creeps up towards Peggy]<br>
              Peggy, flinching away: &quot;Please!&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago 
              waking up in<br>
              bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.&quot;<br>
              Peggy: &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old 
              bedroom slippers<br>
              she slogs around in.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;They're bacteria traps.&quot;<br>
              Peggy: &quot;So you... just learned to live with it?&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;For the most part.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry: &quot;So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't 
              you feel this is<br>
              better?&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;This is nice.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Yes, clothes. This is normal.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking 
              that we could go<br>
              down...&quot;<br>
              [as Melissa continues to talk, Jerry starts imagining her gorgeously 
              naked,<br>
              and stops paying attention]<br>
              Melissa: &quot;Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
              Melissa: &quot;I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...&quot;<br>
              [as Jerry continues to talk, Melissa starts imagining him disgustingly,<br>
              'neanderthalishly' naked, and stops paying attention]<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, [in the shower, on the phone with Jerry]: &quot;So you broke 
              up?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying 
              to picture her<br>
              naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Hang on.&quot;<br>
              [Kramer uses his shower garbage disposal to unclog the tub]<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So what are you up to?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. 
              Hey, how do you<br>
              make those radish roses?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to 
              make it bloom,<br>
              soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No problem there.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Hanke, [working at a Baskin Robbins]: &quot;George. Thanks for coming 
              down to talk<br>
              to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't 
              very<br>
              flexible. I just started yesterday.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, I'm here. What is it?&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought 
              it over, and, you<br>
              know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and 
              you deserve<br>
              much better.&quot;<br>
              George, ready to leave: &quot;Well, thank you.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;You're welcome.&quot;<br>
              Kid, [entering the store]: &quot;Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Waffle or sugar cone?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get 
              into a big thing<br>
              here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was 
              actually an<br>
              apology.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Kid: &quot;Can you get on that cone?&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what 
              are you talking<br>
              about?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', 
              which is nice.<br>
              It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.&quot;<br>
              Kid: &quot;Is there anybody else here but you?&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Hanke: &quot;I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't 
              even think we<br>
              have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I 
              admitted I<br>
              was wrong, so what more do you want from me?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I would like an apology.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;All right, look, you know--&quot;<br>
              Kid #2, [entering the store]: &quot;Did you try it?&quot;<br>
              Kid: &quot;No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone 
              here, if<br>
              you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I 
              want! Now say it<br>
              again, and tell it to me.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was 
              never sorry. It<br>
              was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is 
              it? Can't<br>
              find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What 
              are you<br>
              looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, [eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy]: &quot;Mmm. 
              This food is<br>
              fantastic, Peggy: And what a pretty radish rose, huh?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, thank you.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, 
              free.&quot;<br>
              [all four make toast]<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install 
              a much needed<br>
              and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.&quot;<br>
              [all four make another toast]<br>
              Peggy: &quot;You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made 
              this whole meal in<br>
              there.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;This food was in the shower with you?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.&quot;<br>
              [Peggy, Elaine, and Puddy all gag and wretch]<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George: &quot;Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?&quot;<br>
              Puddy, waiting with Elaine and Peggy: &quot;No, germ-o-phobes.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Kramer.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Right.&quot;<br>
              Download Sound<br>
              <br>
              Hanke, [speaking in front of other Rage-aholics]: &quot;Hi, I'm, 
              uh, Jason. I'm a<br>
              rage-aholic.&quot;<br>
              Audience: &quot;Hi, Jason.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Uh, this is my first meeting.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips 
              Step Nine!&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;Please. Step Nine.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;That's right! He never apologized to me for saying 
              that I would<br>
              stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.&quot;<br>
              [audience laughs]<br>
              George: &quot;It wasn't funny.&quot;<br>
              Hanke: &quot;It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, 
              not to mention<br>
              the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with 
              a v-neck.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!&quot;<br>
              END<br>
