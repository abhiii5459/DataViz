            <p>Jerry: No more crutches, that must be a relief.</p>
            <p>George: Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Not with a cane?</p>
            <p>George: Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's 
              a sad story. </p>
            <p>You through with those?</p>

            <p>George: Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm 
              just now</p>
            <p>getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts 
              me in a</p>
            <p>position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the 
              Yankees-- no</p>
            <p>arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a 
              wife, a family,</p>
            <p>drove a better car than I did.</p>
            <p>Jerry: He drove a car with no arms?</p>
            <p>George: Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest 
              is true. He</p>
            <p>hated me anyway!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I 
              know you?</p>
            <p>George: I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. 
              I feel like a</p>
            <p>gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.</p>
            <p>Kramer walks up holding an institutional sized container of butter.</p>
            <p>Kramer: They hooked me up.</p>
            <p>George: What's with all the butter?</p>
            <p>Kramer: I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?</p>
            <p>Jerry: You can eat it?</p>
            <p>Kramer: No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my 
              body.</p>
            <p>Jerry smirks, Kramer walks away.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.</p>
            <p>George: Who?</p>
            <p>Jerry: The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.</p>
            <p>Bania and Jenna walk over.</p>
            <p>Bania: Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good lookin' huh?</p>
            <p>Jenna: Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.</p>
            <p>Bania: Oh. This is awkward.</p>
            <p>Jenna: Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure.</p>
            <p>Bania and Jenna leave.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I don't believe this.</p>
            <p>George: You miss her, don't you?</p>
            <p>Jerry: No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything 
              off me,</p>

              with</p>
            <p>myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable 
              person. I</p>
            <p>mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.</p>

              between us and</p>
            <p>I say, &quot;Why?&quot; Are we really so different. For what is--</p>

              you and, uh,</p>

            <p>Elaine: This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.</p>
            <p>Passenger (heretofore known as vegetable lasagna): I can here you.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were 
              up to me, we'd</p>

            <p>Jerry: Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for 
              that?</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.</p>

              Shopping</p>
            <p>carts with one bad wheel?</p>
            <p>George: That's true, that always happens to me.</p>
            <p>Jerry: You think that's funny?</p>
            <p>George: I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about 
              too much.</p>
            <p>Jerry: You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!</p>
            <p>George: maybe I am.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh, I'm gonna puke.</p>

            <p>Elaine tries to read but cannot concentrate.</p>

              has</p>
            <p>changed. We're back together two hours, we're having the same problems 
              we had</p>
            <p>12 hours ago.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.</p>

            <p>Mr. Thomassoulo: But your cane's on the wrong side.</p>
            <p>George: That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, 
              when we</p>
            <p>met, I was over there and you were over here so the image was reversed,

            <p>Jerry: If you'll excuse me.</p>
            <p>Jerry bolts through the kitchen door, presumably towards the stage.</p>
            <p>Jerry (OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>New scene.</p>
            <p>Jerry is on stage at the comedy club, Kramer is in the audience.</p>
            <p>Jerry: What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, 
              why do you want</p>
            <p>shade?</p>
            <p>Kramer laughs hysterically, he's the only one.</p>
            <p>Jerry: And what's with people getting sick?</p>
            <p>Newman: Hee hee! Yeah yeah!</p>
            <p>Jerry: I mean, what's the deal with cancer?</p>
            <p>Man in audience: I have cancer!</p>
            <p>Kramer: Oh, tough crowd.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>New scene.</p>
            <p>George is riding his Rascal scooter on a city sidewalk when he 
              accidentally</p>
            <p>bumps another scooter as its owner and some friends are walking 
              out of a nearby</p>
            <p>store.</p>
            <p>Man: Hey, hey! You dented my ride.</p>
            <p>George walks back to inspect the damage.</p>
            <p>George: Whatcha got there, the 4 volt? Heh, I did you a favor.</p>
            <p>Man: How about I do you a favor upside your head?</p>
            <p>George: Oh yeah?</p>
            <p>Man: Oh yeah.</p>
            <p>George leaps back on his scooter and floors it.</p>
            <p>Man: Hey!</p>
            <p>Woman: Get the bikes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>New scene.</p>
            <p>Jerry returns to the comedy club kitchen to a chorus of boos. he's 
              soaked with</p>
            <p>sweat. Kramer and Bania are there.</p>
            <p>Bania: Ouch.</p>
            <p>Kramer: You didn't do so bad.</p>
            <p>Jerry: What are you talking about? I bombed!</p>
            <p>Kramer: No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, 
              it was not</p>
            <p>my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really 
              liked it.</p>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>Jerry: Like who?</p>
            <p>Kramer: Like that guy who yelled out.</p>
            <p>Jerry: He had cancer!</p>
            <p>Kramer: And laughter is the best medicine.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.</p>
            <p>Club Announcer (OC): Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!</p>
            <p>Bania walks out, Jerry leaves, Newman walks in.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big 
              turkey out</p>
            <p>there.</p>
            <p>Newman (salivating): Turkey?</p>
            <p>Kramer: A big fat turkey.</p>
            <p>Newman: I'm sorry I missed that.</p>
            <p>Kramer: He worked so hard and then he just--</p>
            <p>Kramer accidentally knocks over a bowl of oregano, getting it all 
              over himself.</p>
            <p>Kramer: What is this, oregano?</p>
            <p>Just then the other kitchen door swings open and a chef busts through 
              carrying a</p>
            <p>bowl of Parmesan cheese. he trips and empties the bowl all over 
              Kramer.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and 
              it's sticking</p>
            <p>to me because of the butter! Look at me!</p>
            <p>Newman, still salivating, now with a vacant stare, grabs a bunch 
              of green leaves</p>
            <p>and hands them to Kramer.</p>
            <p>Newman: Here. Hold this.</p>
            <p>Kramer: What is this, parsley?</p>
            <p>Newman makes as if to attack Kramer.</p>
            <p>New scene.</p>
            <p>Jerry watching Bania from the wing.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Ah, the sweet stench of failure.</p>
            <p>Kramer and Newman, locked in struggle, run past Jerry and onto 
              the stage.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Get off of me, get off of me!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>New scene.</p>
            <p>City sidewalk, George is leading an extremely low speed chase. 
              Action movie</p>
            <p>music plays, and pedestrians walk by faster than the scooters. 
              George's battery</p>
            <p>dies and his scooter stops.</p>
            <p>Man: Now I got you!</p>
            <p>George jumps up from the scooter, picks it up and begins hauling 
              it as fast as</p>
            <p>he can. He meets up with Mr. Thomassoulo who's exiting a building 
              at that</p>
            <p>moment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thomassoulo: George? Your legs!</p>
            <p>George: Are you a religious man, sir?</p>
            <p>Mr. Thomassoulo: No.</p>
            <p>Unbeknownst to George, the old man catches up to him and is about 
              to lay into</p>
            <p>him with a cane.</p>
            <p>Man: Eat hickory!!</p>
            <p>The man swings the cane at George's head, mercifully the scene 
              changes to Jerry,</p>
            <p>sitting in the bar at the comedy club drinking a glass of champagne. 
              Bania</p>
            <p>walks in.</p>
            <p>Bania: Hey Jerry, didja see it?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Ouch.</p>
            <p>Two men in suits walk in and introduce themselves.</p>
            <p>Stu: Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. 
              Listen,</p>
            <p>Kenny. Really funny out there.</p>
            <p>Jerry: What?</p>
            <p>Jay: That thing you did having the two guys running through? I 
              love stuff you</p>
            <p>don't have to think too much about</p>
            <p>Stu: Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.</p>
            <p>Jay: By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky.</p>
            <p>Bania: How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now 
              I'll have</p>
            <p>one. Looks like I'm following you again.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh, I'm gonna puke.</p>
            <p>Bania: Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>New scene.</p>
            <p>Exterior of NYC airport.</p>
            <p>Elaine: David, this has been the worst month of my life and if 
              I never see you</p>
            <p>again it'll be too soon.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Ditto.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Oh that's origi-</p>
            <p>Puddy: Shut up.</p>
            <p>Elaine gets into a taxi cab.</p>
            <p>Elaine: 86th and Broadway please.</p>
            <p>Cab driver: I'm sorry lady, there's a cab shortage. The Transit 
              Police are</p>
            <p>making everybody share.</p>
            <p>Puddy enters the cab on the left.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Oh no.</p>
            <p>Vegetable Lasagna enters the cab on the right.</p>
            <p>Vegetable Lasagna: Hello! (sees Elaine) Oh no. I'm sorry.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Noooooooooooo!</p>
            <p>Cab rides away.</p>
