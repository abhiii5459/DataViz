            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(The final 'Castle Rock' screen shows, then the end credits roll. 
              Scene cuts to the Coffee shop. George, Elaine, and Jerry enter with 
              suitcases. Elaine has a large bandage on her nose. They all sit 
              down at a booth. All three of them are tired, fed up, and angered)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour 
              plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!</p>
            <p>(Kramer comes in and sits down at the booth with them)</p>
            <p>JERRY: (To George) I said I was sorry.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Confused) What's up with you two?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (To Jerry) So how was the big trip?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened 
              to your nose?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the 
              pain from her nose on the word 'about')</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the 
              wedding? Was the bride radiant?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: She.. was.</p>
            <p>JERRY: 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Interested) Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta 
              go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and 
              heads for the bathroom)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to 
              the bathroom the entire time we were in India.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: India]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;ONE DAY EARLIER&quot; People storm out of a building. 
              All are dressed in wedding apparel)</p>
            <p>SUE ELLEN: That's it! The wedding's off.</p>
            <p>PINTER: What? But, Sue Ellen-</p>
            <p>SUE ELLEN: (Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid 
              of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, 
              and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.</p>
            <p>SUE ELLEN: I have never been so humiliated!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all yoru fault!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed 
              me!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Pleading) George, I'm sorry..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Confused) I don't know what that means.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (To his girlfriend) Alright, Nina, you have to decide right 
              now. Jerry or me?</p>
            <p>NINA: (Casually) Alright.. Neither.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: What?! Well, what are you doing here?</p>
            <p>NINA: A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those 
              boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Five' eight! Five' seven!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're 
              still best friends, right?</p>
            <p>SUE ELLEN: No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take 
              that stupid thing out of your nose!</p>
            <p>(Elaine screams in pain as Sue Ellen pulls the stud out)</p>
            <p>JERRY: That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got 
              to go to the bathroom.</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: A building in India]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;FIFTEEN MINUTES EARLIER&quot; The bride, Sue Ellen, 
              and the Groom, Pinter, are walking down the aisle. Elaine is scattering 
              flowers behind them. Jerry</p>
            <p>walks in and takes a seat)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Whispering to Jerry) Hey.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What happened last night?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, you were pretty loaded.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh. Hello, Tetanus.</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to Nina and George entering the wedding hall)</p>
            <p>NINA: George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a 
              hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking 
              at his shoes) Are those Timberlands painted black?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks tward the bride and groom)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To 
              Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously 
              angered at Jerry) I</p>
            <p>believe you know Nina.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (As George sits down) George, we need to talk.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot 
              more than talk! You betrayed me!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Outraged) &quot;That's all&quot;?! That's everything! 
              I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Pleading) I'm really sorry.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Confused) Where'd you get that one?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's an expression.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's 
              heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her 
              head - apologizing)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle 
              this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with 
              Elaine. That's the only way to</p>
            <p>punish you!</p>
            <p>JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, 
              I might add.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Losing it) Funny guy!</p>
            <p>(Elaine casually makes her way to Jerry and George)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to 
              get married up here!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Reparations!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina 
              slept with (Points to Jerry) him, he slept with me, I slept with 
              Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all</p>
            <p>ancient history.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with 
              the groom?!</p>
            <p>(Everyone goes silent. George and Elaine both look sheepishly. 
              All eyes on them, expecially Sue Ellen)</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: New York street]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;FOUR HOURS EARLIER&quot; Kramer is standing up against 
              a brick wall. All the sudden, he's pegged straight in the face with 
              a snowball. He winces from</p>
            <p>the pain and coldness, then walks up to his friend FDR - the one 
              who threw the snowball at him. He hugs him)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, thank you, FDR!</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: The Coffee shop]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;ONE HOUR EARLIER&quot; Kramer and FDR are both holding 
              a wishbone)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Alright, FDR.. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, 
              you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I 
              get one-hundred percent</p>
            <p>anti-drop-dead protection. Forever.</p>
            <p>FDR: Alright.</p>
            <p>(They each pull, it breaks. FDR won)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, man! Well, then, come on. There's got to be something 
              that'll change your mind, FDR. Something..&quot; (FDR lifts up a 
              cooler, and puts it on the table)</p>
            <p>What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls 
              a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Jerry's room in India]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;THE NIGHT BEFORE, BACK IN INDIA&quot; Elaine is 
              obviously drunk)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was 
              acting so weird.</p>
            <p>JERRY: How did he find out?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: He schnapped me.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You know you're not supposed to drink whil you're keeping 
              a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I can't tell you.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Okay. (Takes a drink) I slept with the groom.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Pinter?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: He used to be called Peter.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?</p>
            <p>ELAIEN: Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. (Elaine, at this 
              point, has climbed onto the couch and is squirming around - she 
              now has her backside to Jerry)</p>
            <p>Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.</p>
            <p>(Elaine climbs onto Jerry's back)</p>

            <p>ELAINE: Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Between laughs) Jugdish.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yes, jugdish.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (While sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor) Hey, what 
              if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa!</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. 
              Well, good night. (Shuts the door)</p>
            <p>(Elaine peers through the blinds on Jerry's door)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Sticking her fingers through the blinds - waving at him)

            <p>KRAMER: Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star 
              last night, and I wished against your wish.</p>
            <p>FDR: That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star 
              and double-wished you to drop dead. (Hands Kramer some coins) Here's 
              your change.</p>

            <p>JERRY: Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging 
              out with you.</p>
            <p>NINA: I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never 
              fooled around..</p>
            <p>NINA: Heh.. yeah.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Probably the reason..</p>
            <p>(They both stare at eachother, then, Jerry clears of the counter 
              with the sweep of his arm, Nina hops onto the counter, and they 
              start going at it)</p>

            <p>[Setting: FDR's apartment building]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;ONE DAY EARLIER&quot; Kramer is standing outside 
              FDR's door, talking to FDR. He is finishing what was once a large 
              lollipop)</p>
            <p>FDR: Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. 
              drop dead! (Slams the door in Kramer's face)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to &quot;TEN MINUTES EARLIER&quot; at Jerry's apartment. 
              Jerry's at his door, talking with Kramer. Kramer's lollipop is slightly 
              bigger)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR 
              wants you to drop dead.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: But you haven't seen..</p>
            <p>JERRY: Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to &quot;TEN MINUTES EARLIER&quot; at FDR's apartment. 
              Kramer and FDR are talking at the door. Kramer's lollipop, of course, 
              is larger than the scene</p>
            <p>before)</p>
            <p>FDR: That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, why?</p>
            <p>FDR: (Sinister) I have my reasons.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out 
              loud, it doesn't come true.</p>
            <p>FDR: That's just a silly superstition. (Slams his door on Kramer)</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to &quot;TEN MINUTES EARLIER&quot; Kramer comes into 
              Jerry's apartment with a huge lollipop)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: FDR?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes 
              telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he 
              blew out his candles, he gives</p>
            <p>me this look..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Guessing the look) Stink eye?</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Also guessing) Crook eye?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Entroducing yet another type of look to the boys) EVIL 
              eye.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, 
              you're thinkin', &quot;These are my friends?!&quot;</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Sarcasticly joking off what George said) Everyday is my 
              birthday.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's 
              bad mojo.</p>
            <p>(Elaine opens the door, hitting Kramer)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hi.</p>
            <p>(Kramer, still wheezing from the door, leaves)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation 
              to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding 
              gown will give her some support.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds 
              up invitation) today.</p>
            <p>JERRY: So you think it's a non-vite?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) 
              Hey, are you gettin' taller?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Showing Elaine his boots) Timberlands.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter 
              Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..</p>
            <p>JERRY: Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Jerry, would you make the call already?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What call?</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Picks up the phone, dialing Nina) He wants me to set him 
              up with this girl, Nina Stengal.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation 
              girl. (Somewhat bitter tward Jerry) The one you think can replace 
              me?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I was kidding when I said that!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (To Elaine) Told me the same thing.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his 
              head 'no') Perfect.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, 
              huh?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: The Coffee shop]</p>
            <p>(Notice: &quot;ONE HOUR EARLIER&quot; George is ordering his meal)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I'll have the clam casino.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Get outta here.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Showing Jerry the menu) &quot;Chef recommends&quot;</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hmm..</p>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>GEORGE: (Motioning tward waitress) I think she likes me.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Sure.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? 
              (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Are you?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, what's the reason?</p>
            <p>JERRY: We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: How engrossing?</p>
            <p>JERRY: If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in 
              Nina and not lose a step.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement 
              lined up for me, do ya?</p>
            <p>(Jerry snickers, then stares at George, smiling)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition 
              from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need 
              an awkward pause.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a 
              minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear 
              them every time I see her.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Why?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a 
              drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!</p>
            <p>JERRY: So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes 
              his meal) Hm.. tastes a little funky.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, I'm sure it's fine.</p>
