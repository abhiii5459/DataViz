      George, drinking 
              tea in his apartment with his girlfriend: &quot;I-I've given this<br>
              a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but we, uh, we have to break up.&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
              George, after hesitating: &quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;We're not breaking up.&quot;<br>
              George, after hesitating: &quot;We're not?&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
              George, after hesitating even longer: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, with George at Monk's: &quot;She said no?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;She said no.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What could I do? We fooled around and went to a movie.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;George, both parties don't have to consent to a breakup. 
              It's not<br>
              like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have 
              to turn<br>
              your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me 
              hear your<br>
              arguments.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, I don't really like her.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That's good.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I don't find her attractive.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Solid.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I'd like to sleep with a lot of other women.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Always popular.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food. 'Oh, 
              Mr. Mashed<br>
              Potatoes, you are so good.'&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You have an airtight case.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;And in bed--&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I'm afraid we're out of time.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, pulling out a jewelry case: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks 
              that he<br>
              actually wore in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em at an auction.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast 
              I'm goin' to<br>
              next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You already have an in. You have the same first name. 
              Jerry.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, that'll intrigue him.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;George Peppard has been dead for years.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Glenn, on the street talking with Elaine: &quot;So you would choose 
              your last meal<br>
              based on the method of execution?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, 
              I'd go for<br>
              something hot and spicy. You know, thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection,<br>
              feels like pasta. You know, painless, don't want anything to heavy.&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;So, um, why don't we get together some time?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your number?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;I think it'd be better if I called you.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. Do-do 
              you work<br>
              around here?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;Mmmm... no, not really.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;I think you're very beautiful.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, laughing: &quot;Oh, ha ha. That'll do.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, in his apartment with Elaine: &quot;What about Puddy?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks. I think 
              it might be<br>
              over.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So, what's this guy about?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, 
              where he worked.<br>
              I'll be he's in a relationship.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity. 
              Elaine, you<br>
              could be dating the Green Lantern!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Which one is he?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Green suit, power ring.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I don't care for jewely on men.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment carrying a large box: &quot;Hey. 
              It happened<br>
              again. Another robbery in the building.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So you bought a cooler?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;And... what would those be?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations. 
              My Tony,<br>
              my... military discharge.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You were in the Army?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this 
              key. Because if<br>
              somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Literally.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;'Literally'? What's that supposed to mean? You mind 
              if I hide this<br>
              somewhere?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, go ahead.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, stuttering gibberish: &quot;A little... privacy, huh?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. Boy, you 
              wouldn't last a<br>
              day in the Army.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, going into the hall with Elaine: &quot;How long did you last?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, that's classified.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, in the hall with Jerry: &quot;Hey, what if he's married?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;No, the Green Lantern.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;OK!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, going back inside with Elaine: &quot;So, you would date a 
              married guy?<br>
              That's so hacky.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be 
              the closest I<br>
              get.&quot;<br>
              [Jerry, getting a spoon out of his silverware drawer, accidentally 
              stumbles<br>
              on the key, and holds it up for Kramer to see]<br>
              Kramer: &quot;You peeked!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;This is your hiding place?!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;It was under a spoon!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, in his apartment with Maura: &quot;And so, for all these 
              reasons, we are<br>
              officially broken up. Thank you, and good night.&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;No, George, we're not.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;But I proved it!&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like 
              launching<br>
              missiles from a submarine. Both of use have to turn our keys.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your 
              key.&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, walking on the street with Glenn: &quot;So, how is a guy 
              like you not<br>
              involved?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;Well, I might ask you the same thing.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, in her mind: &quot;That's true, maybe he's not married.&quot;<br>
              [Glenn gives her a flower]<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, that is so sweet.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, in her mind: &quot;How long do I have to hold this?&quot;<br>
              Glenn, seeing a woman on the street: &quot;Oh, no.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br>
              Glenn, running with Elaine into an alley: &quot;Uh, no one, no one. 
              Here, uh, let<br>
              me show you a short cut. Come on.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, in her mind: &quot;Married. That's it, I'm chucking the 
              flower.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, on the street below Jerry's window: &quot;Jerry! Jerry!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, looking down from his window: &quot;Elaine, what are you 
              doin' down there?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;You didn't hear me buzzing?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, I guess it's broken.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Throw down your key.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I'll catch it!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You'll chicken out at the last second.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah, you're right.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;All right. Well, will you at least keep me company 
              until somebody<br>
              comes out?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, after a pause: &quot;Hey, you know what's weird?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I used to be able to have a huge meal, go right to 
              sleep. But I can't<br>
              anymore.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Nodding off!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating 
              on his wife<br>
              with me.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, to a passerby giving her a dirty look: &quot;We haven't 
              done anything yet.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Elaine: &quot;I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, throwing down a granola bar: &quot;All right. Here!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, walking away from the window: &quot;I'm gonna try and fix 
              the buzzer.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, from the street: &quot;It went in the sewer!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, pulling apart his buzzer and finding the problem: &quot;Hey...&quot;<br>
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment and seeing him at the buzzer 
              box: &quot;What<br>
              are you doin'?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, 
              you hate it that<br>
              I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta 
              know<br>
              everything about it. You're so obsessed with me.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, going into the hallway: &quot;I'm gonna go let Elaine in.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;What are you doing with her?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, hearing the door lock behind him: &quot;Kramer!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Security issue!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, seeing Elaine walking down the hallway towards him: &quot;Oh, 
              hey. You got<br>
              in.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, handing him a large stack of papers: &quot;Yeah, flirted 
              with the menu<br>
              guy.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, taking the menus: &quot;Oh, thanks.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, clattering inside: &quot;That wasn't me!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So, he's definitely married, huh?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Boy, I would've loved to have been there when you told 
              him off.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hmm...&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen 
              him run.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, from inside Jerry's apartment: &quot;OK!&quot;<br>
              [Elaine and Jerry go back inside Jerry's apartment]<br>
              Kramer: &quot;All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your 
              head that this<br>
              is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement.&quot;<br>
              George, from the street below Jerry's window: &quot;Jerry!&quot;<br>
              [George tries to whistle to get Jerry's attention]<br>
              Jerry: &quot;George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, putting on his coat to go downstairs, when he finds the key 
              in his<br>
              coat pocket: &quot;I believe this belongs to you.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Heyyyy!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, opening the ground floor door for George, and seeing him 
              eating a<br>
              granola bar: &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I bought it.&quot;<br>
              Phil, walking up to get inside with George: &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, starting to close the door: &quot;I'm sorry. I-I don't know 
              you.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't 
              let you in.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;But, I live here. I ran out to get some birdseed, and-and 
              I forgot my<br>
              key.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Sounds like a scam.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, closing the door on Phil: &quot;Very sorry.&quot;<br>
              George, waiting for the up elevator with Jerry: &quot;So, I broke 
              up with Maura.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Great, you're lonely and miserable again.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Feels right.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Is that guy still there?&quot;<br>
              George, looking at the door: &quot;He's starin' at us.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Don't look at him.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, when Phil starts to knock on the door: &quot;We don't hear 
              that.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Want a bite?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, I don't.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, in his mind: &quot;I think that ginger ale at the coffee 
              shop is just Coke<br>
              and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit.&quot;<br>
              Maura, coming in George's apartment: &quot;Hey, Honey.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this 
              relationship,<br>
              twice.&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Why does it only seem like I'm the only one working 
              at this breakup?&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;George, I listened to your arguments, and they were 
              rambling and<br>
              flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some 
              dinner.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, at Glenn's small, dingy apartment with him: &quot;So, this 
              is your<br>
              little... love nest?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;Ah, should I light a fire?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, that sounds romantic.&quot;<br>
              Glenn, going outside, through the window: &quot;I'm having a little 
              problem with<br>
              the heat. Uh, I got some cardboard out here.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, in her mind: &quot;This is wrong. I should go.&quot;<br>
              Glenn, from outside: &quot;Can you get that, please?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, sure.&quot;<br>
              [Elaine gasps when she opens the door, seeing the woman from the 
              street that<br>
              Glenn had avoided earlier]<br>
              Lady: &quot;Where's Glenn?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. 
              You know, I'm<br>
              not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I 
              swear.&quot;<br>
              Lady: &quot;Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. 
              Is he home?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;This is his home?&quot;<br>
              Lady: &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;So, he's...&quot;<br>
              Lady: &quot;Poor.&quot;<br>
              Glenn, coming back through the window carrying an old chair: &quot;I 
              think this<br>
              will burn!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, getting into his building elevator from the lobby, and seeing 
              Phil get<br>
              in with him: &quot;So you do live here.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              [going up in the elevator, both men awkwardly stand in silence]<br>
              Jerry, getting off the elevator, as Phil is, too: &quot;You live 
              on this floor?&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, seeing Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door 
              down from<br>
              Kramer's: &quot;So you live right... there.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So I guess I'll see--&quot;<br>
              [Phil, going into his apartment, slams the door behind him]<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, with Jerry at Monk's: &quot;He wouldn't give me his number 
              because he<br>
              doesn't have a phone. He's not married. He's poor.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels, 
              with the<br>
              straps?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;How can I end it over money? I feel bad.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor 
              in any other<br>
              situation?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate 
              on our garbage<br>
              cans.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Good. How did you handle that?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes 
              in the alley<br>
              across the street.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this 
              relationship.<br>
              Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand 
              him... well,<br>
              how much do you think it would be?&quot;<br>
              George, entering Monk's: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, where have you been?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up 
              beyond a<br>
              reasonable doubt.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you 
              know, things<br>
              would have been so much simpler.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Who's this, Blue Arrow?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Green Lantern.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;We found out his super power was lack of money.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;He's invulnerable to creditors.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;We get it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, leaving: &quot;Well crafted.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use 
              to ditch Maura.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.&quot;<br>
              George, now on the same side as the booth of Jerry, with Elaine's 
              side<br>
              vacant: &quot;She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, 
              I'll break<br>
              under the cross. I actually have to do it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Could you move over there?&quot;<br>
              [George reluctantly switches sides, so they're facing each other]<br>
              George: &quot;Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that 
              always had a<br>
              crush on me.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Really? How come you never pursued her before?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;She's too tan. It's the middle of the winter, she's 
              like a carrot.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, coming back into Monk's: &quot;Did I leave my glasses here?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, to Elaine: &quot;He can wipe out his checking account in 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              a single bound!&quot;<br>
              Elaine, leaving again: &quot;Keep 'em!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              [Jerry, as he's entering his apartment to see Kramer there, disturbs 
              some<br>
              sort of bird in the hallway, which makes a squawking noise]<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;There's a giant parrot in the hallway.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;It's Phil's.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Who?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Our neighbor that you turned against. Anyway, I told 
              him it'd be<br>
              fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the 
              hallway.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What'd ya tell him that for?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Because since you've been playing God with the front 
              door, I've been<br>
              tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging 
              out at his<br>
              place.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where 
              does he have the<br>
              couch?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. 
              I hid it at<br>
              Phil's&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;He let you?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No, he doesn't know. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively 
              looking for<br>
              it like some people. You!&quot;<br>
              [going out into the hallway, Kramer is apparently attacked by the 
              parrot,<br>
              because it starts squawking loudly, and Kramer runs back inside 
              Jerry's place]<br>
              <br>
              George, entering his apartment with the too-tan secretary: &quot;So, 
              you... you<br>
              say you've been in the city all winter?&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;I was in Maine for a couple days.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well... here we are.&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;George, I've always fantasized about jumping into 
              bed with you.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Ho ho!&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with 
              you too soon.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of 
              a jam.&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;I want to build something with you, George.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh, not more building.&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;And I won't take no for an answer.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;No?&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
              George, after hesitating: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, in an alley with Glenn: &quot;So, what are we doing in this 
              alley, anyway?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;It's a surprise.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, giggling: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
              [a nearby door opens, and a cook throws a garbage bag out into a 
              trash can;<br>
              Glenn immediately goes for the bag]<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What are you doing? What is that?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;It's a bag of donuts.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;It's garbage.&quot;<br>
              Glenn, looking in the bag: &quot;No, no, no, no, no. When they make 
              the new ones,<br>
              the old ones come out right here.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, pulling out her checkbook: &quot;All right, that's it. How 
              do you spell<br>
              your last name?&quot;<br>
              Glenn, still looking through the garbage bag: &quot;It's a bear 
              claw! You have no<br>
              idea how rare this is.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? 
              Two-fifty?&quot;<br>
              Glenn, eating the bear claw: &quot;Mmm!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Make it three hundred.&quot;<br>
              Glenn, handing her the bear claw: &quot;You know, Elaine, you are 
              the bear claw in<br>
              the garbage can of my life.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, biting the bear claw: &quot;Aw, Glenn.&quot;<br>
              [the cook comes out again, dumping a bucket of water out in the 
              alley, and<br>
              splashing Elaine and Glenn, but they're too wrapped up with each 
              other to<br>
              notice]<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, at Phil's door, which is answered by a woman wearing cleaning 
              gloves<br>
              and carrying a cleaning bucket: &quot;Hi. Is Phil here?&quot;<br>
              Phil, from inside the apartment: &quot;Yeah, I'm here.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Phil... hi. I-I know we kind of got off to a bad start. 
              But your<br>
              bird, which is lovely, by the way, made a mess on my door.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;And?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;That's my wife.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, after an awkward pause: &quot;All right, I think we're done 
              here.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, in his apartment in a tuxedo, with George: &quot;So, you're 
              in a<br>
              relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair 
              with a<br>
              woman who won't have sex with you.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;This isn't going well.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, 
              I have no in!&quot;<br>
              George, starting to leave: &quot;You don't need the cufflinks. You 
              have the same<br>
              name. Jerry!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Where are you goin'? Help me look.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and 
              going to a<br>
              staged reading of Godspell with the other.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Which is with who?&quot;<br>
              George, leaving: &quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo: &quot;Whoo! 
              Boy. Yeah, you<br>
              clean up nice.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I can't go until I find my cufflinks.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I 
              took 'em out of<br>
              your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?&quot;<br>
              Kramer, going into the hall with Jerry: &quot;Yeah, we'll stop by 
              Phil's, we'll<br>
              pick up the key.&quot;<br>
              [in the hall, Jerry and Kramer see Phil and his wife, both crying, 
              going into<br>
              their apartment]<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;Fredo is dead.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to 
              the incinerator?&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;No! my bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, Phil. Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.&quot;<br>
              Phil: &quot;Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! 
              Something in his<br>
              food.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;But I, I didn't--&quot;<br>
              [Phil slams the door on Jerry, and Kramer]<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! And who buries a 
              bird?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... 
              puts it in the<br>
              incinerator.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Just get the key and let's get out here.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;You know, it's a funny thing about that bird dying. 
              I hid the key in<br>
              Fredo's food dish. Whew! That's a weird coincidence.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer!?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You killed Fredo!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Fredo was weak and stupid. He shouldn't've eaten that 
              key.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in 
              the box, and the<br>
              key is in the bird. What are we gonna do?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;You just answered your own question.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, no.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, walking towards his apartment: &quot;I'll get the shovel.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, at Monk's with Loretta: &quot;The, uh, actor that played 
              Jesus made some<br>
              odd choices.&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.&quot;<br>
              Maura, entering Monk's: &quot;George?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;You told me to meet you here for lunch.&quot;<br>
              George, standing up and overreacting: &quot;Oh, I'm caught in my 
              own web of lies!&quot;<br>
              Maura, to Loretta: &quot;I'm Maura.&quot;<br>
              Loretta, to Maura: &quot;I'm Loretta. You want to join us?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, 
              and my<br>
              torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined 
              three<br>
              lives. Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so...&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;George, what we have is too important. We can work 
              through this.&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;So can we.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What? So, this is still not over?&quot;<br>
              Maura: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You?&quot;<br>
              Loretta: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
              George, reluctantly sitting down: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Glenn, in his apartment with Elaine: &quot;Elaine, wow, a TV, a 
              stereo?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have 
              to burn 'em.&quot;<br>
              Glenn, as a woman walks in: &quot;Oh, my God, Allison. You're home 
              early.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br>
              Allison: &quot;His wife.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;You're poor and married?&quot;<br>
              Glenn: &quot;Looks like it.&quot;<br>
              Allison: &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Elaine: &quot;I guess I'm Lois Loan.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, in the pet cemetery with Kramer: &quot;Kramer, I can't believe 
              we're grave<br>
              robbers.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, reading a tombstone: &quot;'Man's best friend.' Jerry, I 
              want something<br>
              like that on my tombstone.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, seeing Fredo's tombstone, and handing the shovel to Kramer: 
              &quot;Oh, my<br>
              God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;All right, then you're the one getting the key out 
              of him.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, taking the shoevel back: &quot;I'll dig.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. 
              I'm gonna go<br>
              check it out.&quot;<br>
              [as Jerry starts to dig, Kramer, still in his tux, walks off, trips 
              over a<br>
              tombstone, and tries to appear dignified again]<br>
              Jerry, hitting metal with the shovel: &quot;Well, that was easy.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Phil, walking in the cemetery with his wife, near Fredo's grave: 
              &quot;All right,<br>
              Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, pulling the metal box out of the ground: &quot;Hey, Kramer! 
              I dug Fredo up,<br>
              now let's cut him open!&quot;<br>
              Phil, seeing Jerry digging up the grave: &quot;Oh, my God!&quot;<br>
              'Mrs. Phil': &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, neighbor.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, in Jerry's apartment with Kramer, Jerry, and Elaine: &quot;All 
              right. I'm<br>
              gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each.&quot;<br>
              George, to Elaine: &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Give me forty, you'll never see me again.&quot;<br>
              [Elaine flips her tongue at George, who rolls his eyes away]<br>
              Elaine, to Jerry: &quot;So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna 
              live here, or are<br>
              you gonna move out, or what?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out 
              of the building.&quot;<br>
              George, flipping open the lid of the strongbox: &quot;So, what's 
              in the cooler?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh. Well, would you look at that. Guess I forgot to 
              lock it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery 
              for something?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry? Really 
              one for the<br>
              books.<br>
              END<br>
