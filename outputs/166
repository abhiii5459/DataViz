            <p>[Setting: Tim Whatley's apartment]</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.</p>
            <p>(Elaine laughs, Whatley enters)</p>
            <p>TIM: Hey! Happy Chanukah!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.</p>
            <p>(Tim holds up a mistletoe)</p>
            <p>TIM: (Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Shrugging it off) eh.</p>
            <p>TIM: (Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again 
              for getting me those Yankee tickets.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)</p>
            <p>TIM: (Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. 
              (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move 
              off camera)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. 
              (leaves)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking 
              me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You have a standard fake?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Mm-hmm.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow 
              her) That's neat.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing 
              it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the 
              woman. The man</p>
            <p>wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)</p>
            <p>DENIM VEST: Hi!</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to Jerry talking to the woman)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.</p>
            <p>WOMAN: Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can 
              run really, really fast.</p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to Elaine)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons</p>
            <p>DENIM VEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out 
              some time?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Coffee Shop]</p>
            <p>(George enters)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Hey.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: &quot;We don't 
              care, and it shows.&quot;</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your 
              mail here?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping 
              through envelopes, reads one ) &quot;Have you seen me?&quot; (Flicks 
              it aside) Nope. (looks at next</p>
            <p>envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.</p>
            <p>JERRY: See? You give, and you get.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Reading the card from Whatley) &quot;This holiday season 
              a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.&quot;?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, that's nice.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper 
              saying &quot;I've given your gift to someone else!&quot;</p>
            <p>JERRY: To a children's charity!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas 
              spirit? And eye for an eye!</p>
            <p>(Elaine enters)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey.</p>
            <p>(Waitress moves tward the table)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm 
              going to &quot;Atomic Sub&quot; later.</p>
            <p>JERRY: &quot;Atomic Sub&quot;? Why are you eating there?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 
              24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What does that mean?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Embarrassed) Free sub.</p>
            <p>(George lets out a depressed sigh while reading a card)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop 
              her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) &quot;Dear son, Happy Festivus.&quot; 
              What is Festivus?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it..</p>
            <p>JERRY: When George was growing up..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Interrupting) Jerry, No!</p>
            <p>JERRY: His father..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: No!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, 
              so he made up his own holiday.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (pleading) Alright..</p>
            <p>JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum 
              pole?</p>
            <p>(Elaine starts laughing uncontrollably - and continues to do so)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!</p>
            <p>JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended 
              up with you crying?</p>
            <p>(Jerry joins in with Elaine's laughter)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy 
              now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine 
              and Jerry laugh hysterically)</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Jerry's apartment]</p>
            <p>(Elaine is digging into her purse)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my &quot;Atomic Sub&quot; 
              card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it 
              when I gave it to denim vest!</p>
            <p>JERRY: So?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a 
              long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!</p>
            <p>JERRY: No, you walk out.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish 
              it.</p>
            <p>JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free 
              sub.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, 
              it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same 
              sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a 
              handkerchief on the old Dean</p>
            <p>Martin show!</p>
            <p>JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see 
              if he's called it?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: That's a good idea.</p>
            <p>(Kramer's cordless phone rings, startling him. He digs through 
              his coat, and pulls it out of the pocket)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! 
              Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm 
              going back to work.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What strike?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, H&amp;H Bagels. That's where I worked.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Worked?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Bagels?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls 
              it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but 
              I haven't seen them in a long time.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&amp;H wouldn't let us use their bath room 
              while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What were your.. demands?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got 
              to go. (Heads for the door)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's 
              embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: H&amp;H Bagel Shop]</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks through the door)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: All right, everybody! I'm back!</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Who are you?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?</p>
            <p>MANAGER: NO, I&quot;m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years 
              ago.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..</p>
            <p>MANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays..</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his 
              coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full 
              of bagels.) What are those?</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Those are rasin bagels.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live 
              to see that..</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Horse Track Betting]</p>
            <p>(Elaine confronts two unattractive bookies)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard 
              fake.</p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>BOOKIE: So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you 
              for 5 years.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give 
              him my real number..</p>
            <p>BOOKIE: (Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.</p>
            <p>(Co-Worker in the back speaks up)</p>
            <p>CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!</p>
            <p>(Various other men in the line behind Elaine say the same thing)</p>
            <p>BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie 
              here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE: (faintly) I'm a man.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ohh.. my..</p>
            <p>BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, 
              uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it. (Slides a pad over 
              to Elaine so she can write it down)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. 
              Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&amp;H's number down) And, uh, 
              tell you what.. (looks at the</p>
            <p>board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at 
              Belmont.</p>

            <p>JERRY: Hey, Tim.</p>
            <p>TIM: What's up?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.</p>
            <p>TIM: Mazel Tov.</p>
            <p>(Jerry's date, Gwen, arrives. She's completely unattractive)</p>

            <p>JERRY: Gwen?</p>
            <p>GWEN: Yeah.</p>
            <p>JERRY: (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?</p>
            <p>GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.</p>

              a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?</p>
            <p>DENIM VEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there 
              now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No, no, no. You give me your number.</p>
            <p>DENIM VEST: Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad, and starts writing a 
              number down) Do you have the mumps?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No.</p>
            <p>DENIM VEST: Typhoid?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No.</p>
            <p>DENIM VEST: (Hands her the paper, and runs off) Yama - Hama!</p>
            <p>(Elaine looks at the number, and sees it's the same as the number 
              on a nearby truck)</p>
            <p>ELAINE: A fake number! Blimey!</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Kruger's office]</p>
            <p>KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting 
              telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, there could be.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: But there isn't.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. 
              (Holds it out)</p>
            <p>KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those 
              donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why 
              you gave me a fake</p>
            <p>Christmas gift.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I 
              don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Vemonous?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted 
              for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove 
              it - if I had to.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: The Costanza's house]</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Happy Festivus!</p>
            <p>FRANK: George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the 
              suit?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.</p>
            <p>FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.</p>
            <p>FRANK: He's gonna see it.</p>
            <p>(Enter Jerry and Elaine. Elaine is still ugly from the steam)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Embracing my roots.</p>
            <p>JERRY: They nailed you on the 20 G's?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Busted cold.</p>
            <p>(Cut to Kruger and Frank)</p>
            <p>(They're looking at the Festivus pole)</p>
            <p>FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.</p>
            <p>(Enter Kramer)</p>
            <p>(Kramer's with the two bookies from Horse Track Betting)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps 
              up and down) Hee, hee, hee!</p>
            <p>BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What are you doing here?</p>
            <p>BOOKIE: Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you 
              out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..</p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see 
              you.. It's a Festivus miracle!</p>
            <p>(Estelle comes through the kitchen door, hitting Kramer as she 
              opens it)</p>
            <p>ESTELLE: Dinner's ready!</p>
            <p>FRANK: Let's begin.</p>
            <p>(Everyone sits around the table. Kruger recognized Kramer from 
              &quot;The Meat Slicer&quot; episode..) KRUGER: Dr.. Van Nostrand?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh.. that's right.</p>
            <p>(Cut to Frank)</p>
            <p>FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with 
              the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! 
              And now you're gonna hear</p>
            <p>about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, God.</p>
            <p>FRANK: (To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, 
              you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. 
              I lost my train of thought.</p>
            <p>(Frank sits down, Jerry gives a face that says &quot;That's a shame&quot;. 
              Gwen walks in)</p>
            <p>GWEN: Jerry!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Gwen! How'd you know I was here?</p>
            <p>GWEN: Kramer told me.</p>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!</p>
            <p>(Jerry gives Kramer a death stare. He shuts up. Gwen notices Elaine)</p>
            <p>GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.</p>
            <p>(Gwen leaves, Jerry follows)</p>
            <p>JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting 
              on the porch.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: (To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?</p>
            <p>BOOKIE: He had to be shot.</p>
            <p>FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Not the feats of strength..</p>
            <p>FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to 
              work a double shift at H&amp;H.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I thought you were on strike?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. 
              Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series 
              of noises) out there.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?</p>
            <p>(Exit Kramer)</p>
            <p>KRUGER: (Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?</p>
            <p>FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus 
              is not over!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, please, somebody, stop this!</p>
            <p>FRANK: (Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!</p>
            <p>(Cuts to an outside view of the Costanza's house)</p>
            <p>ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible.</p>
            <p>FRANK: Stop crying, and fight your father!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!</p>
            <p>FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!</p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: H&amp;H Bagel Shop]</p>
            <p>(Kramer is shaping some dough and chewing gum - his gum falls into 
              the dough. He starts looking for the gum, and starts extracting 
              it from the dough. The manger is</p>
            <p>watching)</p>
            <p>MANAGER: Alright. That's enough. You're fired.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)</p>
