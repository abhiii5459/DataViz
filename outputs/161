              Ivy, &nbsp; &quot;Seinfeld10&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, on the phone: &quot;Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.&quot;<br>
              George, knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese 
              voice:<br>
              &quot;Chinese food!&quot;<br>
              Jerry, hanging up the phone: &quot;Oh! There's my Chinese food, 
              I gotta run. All<br>
              you.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Who was it?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting 
              me a new SAAB.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's 
              blood out of it?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole 
              thing up for me?<br>
              Frank Merman.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Why? He's harmless.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was 
              jealous. Felt<br>
              like he was the summer me.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer 
              me. Whitey Fisk,<br>
              the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I made him up.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Too bad. It was erotic.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment: &quot;Well... I've had it with 
              these<br>
              jackbooted thugs!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;'Pottery Barn'?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That 
              makes eight<br>
              this month.&quot;<br>
              George, holding a magazine cover: &quot;Mira Sorvino. Think she'd 
              go out with me?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Why don't you just throw 'em out?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. 
              And now,<br>
              it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, taking a catalog: &quot;Can I have one? I need one of those 
              old-looking<br>
              phones. So you wanna grab a bite?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So call now.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few<br>
              you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie 
              the one<br>
              that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That's him.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Is he still nuts?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty 
              minutes of 'So,<br>
              who's from out of town?'&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Puddy, finishing eating: &quot;Seriously, is this the best okra 
              you've ever had,<br>
              or what?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Mmm. De-lish.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Delish?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Delish. You know, short for delicious.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Oh, like scrump.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Puddy, leaving: &quot;I'm gonna be late. See ya later.&quot;<br>
              Jack: &quot;Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?&quot;<br>
              Elaine, passing him the ketchup: &quot;Oh, sure.&quot;<br>
              Jack: &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
              Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face<br>
              <br>
              Estelle, answering the phone: &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Hey, it's Georgie.&quot;<br>
              Estelle: &quot;Let me put your father on the phone.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Ma!&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the 
              other day, and,<br>
              you know what, you were right.&quot;<br>
              Estelle, feigning a Chinese, muffled voice: &quot;Chinese food.&quot;<br>
              Frank, hanging up: &quot;Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. 
              Talk to you<br>
              later.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Chinese food?&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store: &quot;Hey, 
              you like<br>
              sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry: &quot;So, maybe they had Chinese food?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing 
              stun<br>
              grenades.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese 
              food, there's<br>
              leftovers.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, entering Jerry's apartment: &quot;Well, gentlemen. Lainie 
              is... in love.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food 
              leftovers.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, 
              totally unreal,<br>
              fairy tale moment.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new 
              guy, in a big pot<br>
              of love stew.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I 
              see if this new<br>
              guy can... handle the workload.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment: &quot;Will you look at this? 
              More catalogs!<br>
              'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these<br>
              companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Stop the mail?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;That's... even better!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Frankie: &quot;Jerry!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;This is it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Inside the van?&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked 
              about how cool<br>
              it would be to have a van and just drive?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;We were ten.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;Come on. Let's take it for a spin.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I don't want a van.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. 
              When we were in<br>
              camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and 
              sit in it.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper 
              sticker that<br>
              says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Always helpful.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Estelle: &quot;Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called 
              me back.&quot;<br>
              Estelle: &quot;Uh... the phone broke.&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;Well, we got to get moving.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What? Where are you going?&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;We have a catered affair.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You're going like that?&quot;<br>
              Frank, leaving the kitchen: &quot;It's creative black tie. Move, 
              woman.&quot;<br>
              George, checking the fridge: &quot;No Chinese leftovers. George 
              is gettin'<br>
              suspicious.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jack: &quot;Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.&quot;<br>
              Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face<br>
              Jack: &quot;I'm gonna be in the can.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Okay, Jack.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, to the cashier: &quot;Can I use your phone?&quot;<br>
              Cashier (Ruthie Cohen): &quot;Sure.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, over the phone: &quot;Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. 
              Yeah, that's<br>
              right. Again.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Frankie, in the van with Jerry: &quot;Nice captain's chairs, huh?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Aye, aye.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.&quot;<br>
              Large-vehicle reverse beeping starts<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;No, that's us.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if 
              I decided that<br>
              it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York 
              City. Is<br>
              there maybe some way I could exchange it?&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;You don't like the van?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, no, no. Just hypothetically.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Frankie: &quot;I gotta go to the park.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a 
              van guy.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, showing Jerry his mailbox: &quot;Check it out. Rain and 
              sleet may not stop<br>
              them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Where'd you get the bricks?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Jerry, the whole building is brick.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm 
              gonna try to<br>
              sell the van to a lot.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell 
              it privately.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I don't think I want to meet the people that are in 
              the market for a<br>
              used van.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer: &quot;Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;OK.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 
              'For sale. A big,<br>
              juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I don't want to trade.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their 
              buying bone.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're 
              puttin' it in my<br>
              box now.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing 
              me, and<br>
              pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk 
              to them.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is 
              Jack.&quot;<br>
              Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face<br>
              <br>
              Postal Employee: &quot;May I help you?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.&quot;<br>
              Postal Employee: &quot;Certainly. How long would you like us to 
              hold it?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, 
              permanently.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your 
              three hour break?<br>
              Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, yes, I am.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;What about your bills?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;The bank can pay 'em.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;The bank. What about your cards and letters?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams,<br>
              holograms.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. 
              What do you<br>
              think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know 
              the half of<br>
              what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.&quot;<br>
              Supervisor: &quot;Is everything all right here, Postal Employee 
              Newman?&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. 
              Isn't it, Mr.<br>
              Kramer?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, surprising his parents in the kitchen: &quot;Welcome back.&quot;<br>
              Estelle: &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Quick for a... catered affair.&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;I don't know what you mean.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know 
              what's going on!&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love 
              you like a son,<br>
              but even parents have limits.&quot;<br>
              Estelle: &quot;The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with 
              the calls.&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed 
              to be our<br>
              time.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I'm not following.&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;We're cuttin' you lose.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You're cuttin' me loose?&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to 
              your mother.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George: &quot;They don't want to see me anymore!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;But this is what you've always wanted.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;It is. I'm just not ready yet.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Aw, that's kind of sweet.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore 
              me. Heh heh.<br>
              Well, they better think again.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Mother of God.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. 
              They'll be all<br>
              over me. Who is this guy?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. 
              I think he may<br>
              have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what 
              is this?&quot;<br>
              On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, 
              chanting<br>
              &quot;Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That is the guy!&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just 
              remembering<br>
              this old commercial.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;That's pretty pathetic.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I know. They're not even related.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, entering Jerry's apartment: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. So, what do 
              you know about<br>
              this Jack fellow?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Isn't he the best?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. 
              It's not<br>
              much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, turning on the commercial: &quot;Right, quiet dignity. As 
              opposed to, say,<br>
              this?&quot;<br>
              On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, 
              chanting<br>
              &quot;Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, no.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, yes.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, answering the phone: &quot;Hello? Yeah, the van is still 
              for sale. Sure,<br>
              come on buy.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, rushing into Jerry's apartment: &quot;Yeah, I called about 
              the van.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, at dinner with his cousin: &quot;Some more merlot?&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very 
              attractive.&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop 
              myself from...<br>
              wanting you.&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;You want to borrow money, right?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;All right?&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;Let's go for it.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well... we could dance around it a little first.&quot;<br>
              Rhisa, playing &quot;footsie&quot;: &quot;Nah. Let's be bad, George. 
              Let's be really... bad.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Whoa! Whoa! Geez!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, inspecting Jerry's van: &quot;So, how come you're selling 
              it?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;How many miles?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Two.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;City or highway?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?&quot;<br>
              Kramer, breaking the antenna: &quot;Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm 
              not gonna be<br>
              pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not 
              paying for<br>
              that.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;All right, just get out of here.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very 
              interested in the<br>
              van.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this 
              van today?'&quot;<br>
              Kramer, pointing to the newspaper ad: &quot;Well, I don't really 
              have any money.<br>
              But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You put that in!&quot;<br>
              Kramer, pulling out an undershirt: &quot;And I'm glad I did. Here.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You want to trade me an undershirt?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's 
              undershirt. He<br>
              took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That's disgusting.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, it's my final offer.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Puddy: &quot;You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's 
              just put it<br>
              behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.&quot;<br>
              Puddy: &quot;Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and 
              you see the Maytag<br>
              repairman.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;You're not taking me back?&quot;<br>
              Puddy, leaving: &quot;That's right.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. 
              Nobody...&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, handing out anti-mail pamphlets: &quot;Here you go. Mail 
              is evil. Pass it<br>
              on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Woman: &quot;Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Because we're blind to their tyranny.&quot;<br>
              Woman: &quot;Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah. Move along, Betty.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood<br>
              memorabilia.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;I'm, uh, I'm so stupid.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Frankie, running away: &quot;I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, nice to meet you.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry: &quot;She's into it?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;So have your parents found out about it?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have 
              a real future<br>
              together.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Brave new world, alright.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, entering Monk's: &quot;Hey, you guys.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post 
              office today,<br>
              and not one person went in.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;It's Sunday.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, I want my van keys back.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's 
              t-shirt.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Are you insane? Give 'em to me.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow 
              it. Yeah, he<br>
              wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This 
              is perfect.<br>
              I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides 
              the door<br>
              open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and 
              he was very upset<br>
              that I had your wheels.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, no, not Frankie.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running 
              into the<br>
              park.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, no, the woods! The hole!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;Kramer, what the hell are you doing?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;Not that!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking 
              to you, but<br>
              I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen: you 
              may be<br>
              walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail 
              truck will<br>
              slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe 
              even<br>
              trust, will offer to give you a lift.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Are you through?&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;No! And no one will ever see you again!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Are you through?&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.&quot;<br>
              Newman, seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer: 
              &quot;Quick! Get<br>
              in!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was 
              going down.&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;There's another way it can go down, and it's going 
              down right now!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman 
              I know!&quot;<br>
              Newman: &quot;I know you know, but you don't know what I know.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, being grabbed by the security officials: &quot;Hey!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry: &quot;Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?&quot;<br>
              Hole Digger: &quot;My name is Edgar.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Have a nice night.&quot;<br>
              Hole Digger: &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Frankie, digging a hole, talking to himself, and seeing Jerry's 
              van pull up<br>
              near him: &quot;Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;All right, George. I'm ready.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading 
              on my<br>
              dashboard compass. Where are my parents?&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;Geor-gie...&quot;<br>
              Frankie, running up to the van and yelling through the window: &quot;Is 
              this<br>
              Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!&quot;<br>
              Rhisa, hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van: &quot;Wait. 
              What's<br>
              he saying?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;No, they caught him.&quot;<br>
              George, running out and away from the van: &quot;I knew it wasn't 
              Berkowitz!&quot;<br>
              Frankie, seeing George running away: &quot;Ohh...&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine: &quot;So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with 
              Jack.'&quot;<br>
              Jack: &quot;Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Really, what was the first?&quot;<br>
              Jack, pulling out his Wiz hat: &quot;They're bringing me back. Yeah. 
              I'm the Wiz<br>
              again.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Jack, dancing around: &quot;I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Well what, what about your fact-checking job?&quot;<br>
              Jack, dancing around: &quot;Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the 
              Wiz! I'm the Wiz<br>
              and noooobody beats me!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, finding Frankie, in his hole, in the woods: &quot;Frankie... 
              come on out of<br>
              there.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;You hate the van.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being 
              a van guy,<br>
              it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;So, can we go for a ride?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Yeah, let's just get out of here.&quot;<br>
              Hole Digger #2, eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it: &quot;Are 
              you done<br>
              with that?&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Frank, coming upon the van, supposedly left by Kramer for him, in 
              the woods:<br>
              &quot;Good. He left the door unlocked.&quot;<br>
              Estelle: &quot;Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.&quot;<br>
              Estelle, looking inside of the van: &quot;Wow!&quot;<br>
              Frank, reclining the seats in the van to a bed: &quot;Hey, look 
              at this. Hoochie<br>
              mama!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Oh, my goodness. What have they done to 
              you here?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Huh? Who are you?&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Well, you can just call me Henry.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Last time I checked.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Henry... can I get out of here now?&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, 
              after all, I drove<br>
              all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh?&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;I even had to cancel a round of golf with 
              the secretary<br>
              of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of 
              your material<br>
              here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. 
              I mean, just<br>
              imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood<br>
              handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah! Ha ha.&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn 
              serious about it.<br>
              In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, 
              it's the<br>
              job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand 
              why<br>
              I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;I'm very, very sorry.&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General: &quot;Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack 
              of mail out<br>
              at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't 
              you Mr.<br>
              Kramer?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Sure do!&quot;<br>
              Postmaster General, receiving a salute from Kramer: &quot;Now, that's 
              better.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his 
              head,<br>
              escorted by a security man: &quot;Geez. Newman?&quot;<br>
              Newman, whimpering: &quot;Tell the world my story.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey, George!&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh. The summer me.&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;The winter me.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You must be George's cousin.&quot;<br>
              Rhisa: &quot;Girlfriend.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              George, seeing Jerry's van shaking: &quot;What is that? That van's 
              a-rockin'.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Don't go a-knockin'.&quot;<br>
              Estelle, after George opens the van door: &quot;Oh, my god!&quot;<br>
              George, seeing his parents being &quot;intimate&quot;: &quot;Oh, 
              my god!&quot;<br>
              Frankie: &quot;Now you gotta sell this van.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              <br>
              Frank: &quot;What you saw in that van was a natural expression of 
              a man's love for<br>
              his lady.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Ohhhh...&quot;<br>
              Estelle: &quot;Your father's right. It's beautiful.&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;And it was safe.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh, God...&quot;<br>
              Frank: &quot;Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and 
              I...&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh... make it stop.&quot;<br>
              END</p>
