              George: &quot;Keep it real!&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Let's get nuts!&quot;<br>
              George, at Monk's with Jerry: &quot;When are they gonna learn that 
              any news about<br>
              China is an instant page-turner?&quot;<br>
              George, seeing Jerry with a small black device: &quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm 
              goin' to Florida<br>
              for his birthday.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;How much was it?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't 
              care about the<br>
              gift. He gets excited about the deal.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe 
              it's hot. That's<br>
              his favorite.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I got a message from the Rosses at work today.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to 
              them?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, 
              I always kinda<br>
              felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? 
              That's silly.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, entering Monk's with her boyfriend: &quot;Oh, um... Darryl. 
              These are...<br>
              people I know. Jerry, George.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see 
              you later.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;OK.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Still no Puddy?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just 
              gave up. Well,<br>
              what do you think?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big 
              deal?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What black guy?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Darryl. He's black, isn't he?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;He is?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;No, he isn't.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Isn't he, Elaine?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;You think?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I thought he looked Irish.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What's his last name?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Nelson.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;That's not Irish.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I think he's black.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Should we be talkin' about this?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I think it's OK.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;No, it isn't.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;If he's black.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Is he black?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Does it matter?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, so you need to know?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be 
              nice if I knew.&quot;<br>
              Waitress: &quot;Should I take that?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, getting out his wallet: &quot;Uh, one second.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, looking in her purse: &quot;Oh, here.&quot;<br>
              George, pulling out some money: &quot;Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... 
              yeah.&quot;<br>
              [when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly get 
              out lots<br>
              of money for her tip]<br>
              <br>
              George, with Jerry in his apartment, on the phone: &quot;Uh, Mrs. 
              Ross? It's-it's<br>
              George.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Uh, who?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no 
              speak.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross, walking by Mrs. Ross: &quot;We're all out of lime juice. 
              I told that<br>
              woman to buy more.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having 
              an event this<br>
              weekend.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, 
              and I have got<br>
              to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross, again walking by: &quot;I'm goin' back to bed.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Thank you for calling, George.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... 
              OK, I gotta<br>
              go.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;House in the Hamptons?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for 
              a few years. I<br>
              figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment to find Jerry and George: &quot;Well.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Wow. What are we celebrating?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Uh, you remember my coffee table book?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;With the little legs?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned 
              it for a movie.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;How are they gonna make that book into a movie?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Independence Day?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;How much are they payin' you?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working 
              for a while.<br>
              A long while.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;That's funny because I haven't seen you working for 
              a while. A long<br>
              while.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging 
              it up. Boys, I'm<br>
              retiring.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;From what?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've 
              accomplished<br>
              everything I've set out to do.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, seeing that Kramer has a new watch: &quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold 
              watch.&quot;<br>
              Jerry and George: &quot;Ooh!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, it's not really gold.&quot;<br>
              Jerry and George: &quot;Aww.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              [approaching Darryl's apartment, Elaine hears loud rap music being 
              played,<br>
              and smiles knowingly]<br>
              Elaine, as Darryl opens his door: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Great music.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty 
              four hours a day.<br>
              I hate it.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Yo, you! Turn it down!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural 
              significance?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;They're... African.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Right. African.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;South Africa.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out 
              years ago, for<br>
              obvious reasons. You know how it is.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Maybe.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, to a street vender selling hot dogs: &quot;You must hate 
              hot dogs, huh? Or<br>
              else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.&quot;<br>
              [the Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street, observe 
              George not<br>
              being in the Hamptons, and move on]<br>
              George: &quot;I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be 
              eatin' hot dogs<br>
              all the time.&quot;<br>
              Vender: &quot;Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Mmm... no.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Morty, in Florida, as Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken 
              up:<br>
              &quot;Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;It's 5:30 in the morning!&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;We let you sleep in.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, handing his dad a gift: &quot;Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, 
              I got you a<br>
              birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty 
              miles an hour.<br>

              You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard<br>
              organizer.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;This looks like too much money.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, 
              fifty bucks.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;You think it's hot?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Could be.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;I'm right here.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, 
              fax, there's a<br>
              calculator.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the 
              tip?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily 
              planner.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a 
              neighbor:<br>
              &quot;Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer, what are you doing here?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped 
              on it.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people 
              come to die.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, getting looks from his parents: &quot;Not you. Older people.&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. 
              How 'bout a<br>
              feta cheese omelette?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;If you feed him, he'll never leave.&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and 
              Egg Beaters?&quot;<br>
              Kramer, immaturely: &quot;I guess.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I can't believe this.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Elaine, with George at Monk's: &quot;So, George, do you have any 
              thoughts on this<br>
              Darryl situation?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Actually, I did have a thought.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Why don't you just ask him?&quot;<br>
              Elaine, rudely and giving him a 'duh' look: &quot;Because, if I 
              ask him, then it's<br>
              like I really want to know.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Maybe he's, um... mixed.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Is that the right word?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' 
              about this.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              George, standing up: &quot;I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, starting to leave: &quot;You know what, I'm leavin'.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, seeing the Rosses entering Monk's: &quot;Oh. Mrs. Ross, 
              Mr. Ross.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Oh, you're George's friend.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened 
              to his<br>
              place in the Hamptons?&quot;<br>
              Elaine, laughing uproariously: &quot;The Hamptons? George Costanza? 
              I, uh... I<br>
              don't think so. Have a good one.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Rosses.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;George, we were just talking about you.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But 
              this was one of<br>
              those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yeah, I may move out there.&quot;<br>
              George, getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses: &quot;I mean 
              it, I'll do<br>
              it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Morty, eating lunch with Helen and Jerry: &quot;Another fine meal, 
              and now for my<br>
              Wizard tip calculator.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Dad, it's got lots of other functions.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions.&quot;<br>
              Morty, trying to open it: &quot;I can't get it open.&quot;<br>
              [Jerry easily opens it]<br>
              Helen: &quot;Yay! Jerry got it open.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill 
              the water.<br>
              How does 12.4% sound?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, looking at the Wizard: &quot;Well, your tip is four dollars 
              and thirty-six<br>
              point six six six six cents.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;We'll round down.&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your 
              father's<br>
              birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because 
              you were<br>
              impeached at the other condo.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;I was never impeached! I resigned!&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Even so, the press would bury him!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;What press?&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Pinko Commie rag.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Old Man, coming up to the three Seinfelds: &quot;Hey, Morty. Your 
              boy here, he<br>
              just got a date with that young aquacise instructor.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;She's fifty.&quot;<br>
              Old Man: &quot;You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's 
              my man.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;All right, I'll see you guys.&quot;<br>
              Old Man: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              [Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next 
              to him,<br>
              staring at his face]<br>
              Kramer, taping Morty's glasses: &quot;Morty, what're you lookin' 
              at?&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president 
              of Del<br>
              Boca Vista, Phase Three.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Hmm.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Darryl, with Elaine in his apartment: &quot;Elaine, thank you for 
              the Wizard!&quot;<br>
              [Elaine laughts somewhat awkwardly]<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Wow, it's got so many functions.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is 
              first. Warranty<br>
              information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Well, I don't do that stuff.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. 
              Um. Oh,<br>
              here's one: race.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Isn't that optional?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! 
              But they really<br>
              would like to know.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;All right, I'm... Asian.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Just to mess with 'em.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: laughing awkwardly: &quot;Oh. Right. Good one.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Does that matter?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;No, but... it is very nice to know.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine: &quot;So 
              did you figure<br>
              out Darryl's... you know.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, in Jerry's apartment: &quot;Ah, I've given up. So, now we're 
              going to a<br>
              bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, as Kramer walks by: &quot;You're a master of race relations.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Yeah, it's all my father's doing.&quot;<br>
              [Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry 
              to hand him<br>
              a magazine from the table]<br>
              Jerry: &quot;He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then 
              wield power<br>
              from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.&quot;<br>
              George, entering Jerry's apartment: &quot;Jerry?&quot;<br>
              Elaine, to George: &quot;He's still down with his folks.&quot;<br>
              George, to Elaine: &quot;What are you doin' here?&quot;<br>
              Jerry, overhearing the other two: &quot;Elaine, Elaine--&quot;<br>
              Elaine, to George: &quot;I'm gettin' his mail.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, overhearing the other two: &quot;Oh, no.&quot;<br>
              George, to Elaine: &quot;He asked you to get the mail?&quot;<br>
              Elaine, to George: &quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;<br>
              George, taking the phone from Elaine: &quot;Jerry, why is Elaine 
              getting your<br>
              mail?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;George, listen to me. I have a very important job for 
              you. I want you<br>
              to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't 
              dry out and<br>
              leak.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, trying to understand what they're talking about: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;What about the mail?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, 
              George.&quot;<br>
              George, hanging up: &quot;All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, with Elaine in Jerry's apartment: &quot;So, I ran into the 
              Rosses again.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get 
              the idea that you<br>
              have a place in the Hamptons?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;From me.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did 
              you say?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;So, they knew? Those liars!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;But you lied first.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              George: &quot;Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, 
              they<br>
              never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're 
              lying.<br>
              You call them a liar!&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Like you're a liar!&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses 
              and inviting<br>
              them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see 
              who blinks<br>
              first.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Haven't you done enough to these people?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, 
              I have to exercise<br>
              Jerry's gaskets.&quot;<br>
              [Elaine gets a sarcastic, 'oh, boy' expression]<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, to a room: &quot;Vote for Kramer.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, to a man walking by: &quot;Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for 
              condo president.<br>
              I'd like your vote. Thanks.&quot;<br>
              Kramer, to an old woman: &quot;Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is 
              a vote for<br>
              Kramer.&quot;<br>
              Old Woman: &quot;Will you cut my meat?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Gladly.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Waitress, to Darryl, who's with Elaine at Monk's: &quot;Coffee?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Sure.&quot;<br>
              Waitress, to Darryl: &quot;Are you black? Or should I bring some 
              cream.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;I'm black.&quot;<br>
              Darryl, re-thinking: &quot;Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream.&quot;<br>
              Darryl, seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine: &quot;Did 
              you hear that?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;God, there are still people who have trouble with 
              an interracial<br>
              couple.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Interracial? Us?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Isn't that unbelievable!?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial 
              couple.<br>
              That is racism!&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;I don't feel like eating.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George: &quot;So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Sounds grand.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Do you have your bathing suits?&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;It's March.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's 
              a two-hour drive.<br>
              Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. 
              All<br>
              right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Jerry, in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room: 
              &quot;Hey,<br>
              Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you 
              need to take<br>
              a vitamin.&quot;<br>
              Jerry, as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic 
              sweatsuit:<br>
              &quot;Dad, you look so different.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, 
              one... must<br>
              walk among them.&quot;<br>
              Morty, coming into the hall: &quot;This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's 
              the<br>
              election!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. 
              But then<br>
              when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight 
              p.m.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;You know, you can put that whole schedule right in 
              your daily<br>
              planner.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Daily what?&quot;<br>
              Helen, coming into the condo: &quot;Have you read today's Boca Breeze?&quot;<br>
              Kramer, looking at the newsletter: &quot;Hey, look at that. Picture 
              of me, huh?&quot;<br>
              Kramer, reading out loud: &quot;Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot 
              in<br>
              clubhouse.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is 
              against the<br>
              rules.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, I couldn't find my shoes.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives 
              to move down<br>
              here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.&quot;<br>
              Helen: &quot;Who wants hot chocolate?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Oh, yeah! Me.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, 
              huh?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Wizards!&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every 
              member on the<br>
              condo board.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer...&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you 
              can get that<br>
              deal.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what 
              do we next,<br>
              Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?&quot;<br>
              Morty, rushing to his bedroom: &quot;First, I need a nap.&quot;<br>
              Helen, running after him: &quot;Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, what about your deal, huh?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a 
              pop. What do I<br>
              do?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Down here?&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              George, driving in the car with the Rosses: &quot;And that leads 
              into the master<br>
              bedroom.&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Tell us more.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into 
              the solarium.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;Another solarium?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, 
              too?&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;What are their names?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy 
              you a<br>
              housewarming gift.&quot;<br>
              George, chuckling to himself: &quot;Housewarming gift.&quot;<br>
              George, swerving the car to go to the antique stand: &quot;All right, 
              we're taking<br>
              it up a notch!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Waitress at Monk's, handing Elaine a menu: &quot;Here you go.&quot;<br>
              Elaine, to the black waitress: &quot;Long day?&quot;<br>
              Waitress: &quot;Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I hear ya, Sister.&quot;<br>
              Waitress: &quot;Sister?&quot;<br>
              Elaine, as Darryl comes into Monk's: &quot;Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's 
              black.<br>
              Here he is. See?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Hi, Elaine.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
              Waitress: &quot;He's black?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;I'm black?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Aren't you?&quot;<br>
              Waitress, leaving: &quot;I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;We are. Because you're Hispanic.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I am?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Aren't you?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;No. Why would you think that?&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking 
              me to those<br>
              Spanish restaurants.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;That's because I thought you were black.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because 
              I'm black?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I don't think we should be talking about this.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;So, what are you?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I'm white.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;So, we're just a couple of white people?&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;I guess.&quot;<br>
              Darryl: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
              Elaine: &quot;Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?&quot;<br>
              Darryl, leaving with Elaine: &quot;Sure.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Kramer, having lunch with Jerry and his parents: &quot;Oh, well... 
              I handed out<br>
              all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think 
              we've got<br>
              this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman 
              Burgerman,<br>
              he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Aw.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Congratulations, Mr. President.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.&quot;<br>
              Old Man: &quot;Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br>
              Old Man: &quot;It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!&quot;<br>
              Old Man #2: &quot;Mine doesn't have a seven!&quot;<br>
              Old Man #3: &quot;I'm ruined!&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;You didn't have a deal?&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;No deal. Not hot.&quot;<br>
              Old Man: &quot;Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished.&quot;<br>
              Kramer: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
              Old Man: &quot;Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.&quot;<br>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              Kramer, getting up to leave: &quot;Well, the people have spoken. 
              Well, that's it<br>
              for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;Dad, I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
              Morty: &quot;You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars 
              on a tip<br>
              calculator?!&quot;<br>
              Jerry: &quot;It does other things!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Mr. Ross, with his wife and George, on a beach: &quot;Where are 
              we, George?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Almost there.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your 
              house?&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;We, uh, we go on foot from here.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. 
              There's no<br>
              Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;We know.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out 
              here? Why<br>
              didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?&quot;<br>
              Mrs. Ross: &quot;We don't like you, George.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.&quot;<br>
              George: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Ross: &quot;All right! Let's head back.&quot;<br>
