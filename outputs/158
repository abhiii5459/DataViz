      Episode 158 (October 
              2, 1997)</p>
            <p>(Scene: In the 
              Play Now office)</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: George, 
              you&#146;re not really handicapped, are you? </p>
            <p>George: I&#146;ve 
              had my difficulties. </p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: I 
              saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized 
              cart with one hand. </p>
            <p>George: Mr. Thomassoulo 
              during times of great stress, people are capable of super human 
              strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: No 
              </p>
            <p>George: How about 
              the old Spider Man live action show?</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: George, 
              I&#146;ve realized we&#146;ve signed a one-year contract with you, 
              but at this point I think it&#146;s best that we both go our separate 
              ways. </p>
            <p>George: I don&#146;t 
              understand.</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: We 
              don&#146;t like you. We want you to leave. </p>
            <p>George: Clearer</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Monks 
              Caf)</p>
            <p>Jerry: So you&#146;re 
              staying at Play Now?</p>
            <p>George: Why not? 
              Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped 
              toilets in the city.</p>
            <p>Jerry: But they 
              not you aren&#146;t handicapped, aren&#146;t you ashamed?</p>
            <p>George: They&#146;re 
              the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. 
              As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.</p>
            <p>(Elaine walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>Elaine: Hey</p>
            <p>Jerry &amp; George: 
              (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! </p>
            <p>George: Hello-o-o-o 
              Elaine!</p>
            <p>Elaine: What&#146;s 
              that?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh, it&#146;s 
              just this stupid thing. </p>
            <p>Elaine: Well, 
              I&#146;m sure it&#146;s stupid. It&#146;s not about me, is it?</p>
            <p>Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) No-o-o-o.</p>
            <p>George: (doing 
              the voice) Not at all.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Tell me!</p>
            <p>Jerry: All right. 
              You know this girl Clare I am seeing? </p>
            <p>Elaine: Yeah.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Well, he 
              and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays 
              awake all night and talks to me.</p>
            <p>Elaine: How is 
              it talking?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Well, her 
              belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) I&#146;m bored. 
              Talk to me.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Oh I gotta 
              start taking these &quot;stupid&quot; warnings more seriously.</p>
            <p>(Puddy walks in)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey, look 
              whose here - Puddy. </p>
            <p>Elaine: My Puddy? 
              But we broke up.</p>
            <p>Jerry: And yet 
              he continues to live.</p>
            <p>(Puddy walks over 
              to the table)</p>
            <p>Puddy: Hey Benes, 
              How are you?</p>
            <p>Elaine: I&#146;m 
              doing great. </p>
            <p>Puddy: Great. 
              (pauses) See ya.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Well, that&#146;s 
              it. You two are back together.</p>
            <p>Elaine: What?</p>
            <p>Jerry: The bump 
              into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.</p>
            <p>Elaine: David 
              and I <i>will</i> not be getting back together. </p>
            <p>Jerry: Elaine, 
              breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can&#146;t 
              do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, 
              and then it goes over.</p>
            <p>George: That&#146;s 
              beautiful.</p>
            <p>Elaine: What about 
              you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.</p>
            <p>Jerry: That&#146;s 
              different. I didn&#146;t have feelings for those people. But you, 
              you&#146;ll backslide</p>
            <p>Elaine: You want 
              to bet?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Stakes?</p>
            <p>Elaine: 50</p>
            <p>Jerry: Dollars?</p>
            <p>Elaine: All right. 
              Witness? (looks at George).</p>
            <p>George: Witness.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Done.</p>
            <p>George: Percentage?</p>
            <p>Jerry &amp; Elaine: 
              No.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>Clare: So I&#146;ll 
              call you tonight?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Yeah.</p>
            <p>Clare: What&#146;s 
              wrong with the belt?</p>
            <p>Jerry: I went 
              to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled 
              a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of 
              the urinal. So&#133;(throws away belt) that&#146;s it!</p>
            <p>Clare: So, you&#146;re 
              insane?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh yes, 
              quite.</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Hello!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Of course 
              it&#146;s a sliding scale.</p>
            <p>Clare: Catch you 
              later.</p>
            <p>Kramer &amp; Jerry: 
              (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)</p>
            <p>Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.</p>
            <p>Kramer: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.</p>
            <p>(Kramer is reading 
              the newspaper at the table)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Look at 
              this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh, that 
              restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that&#146;s a 
              good idea.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Of course 
              it&#146;s a good idea, it&#146;s <i>my</i> idea. I conceived this 
              whole project two years ago.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Which part? 
              The renovating the restaurant you don&#146;t own part or spending 
              the two hundred million you don&#146;t have part?</p>
            <p>Kramer: You see 
              I come up with these things, I know they&#146;re gold, but nothing 
              happens. You know why?</p>
            <p>Jerry: No resources, 
              no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.</p>
            <p>Kramer: (interrupts) 
              No, no&#133;time! It&#146;s all this meaningless time. Laundry, 
              grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any 
              idea how much time I waste in this apartment?</p>
            <p>Jerry: I can ball 
              park it.</p>
            <p>(Elaine walks 
              in &#150; how did she come up without the buzzer?)</p>
            <p>Elaine: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o!</p>
            <p>Kramer: Here we 
              go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey, I 
              called you last night, where were you?</p>
            <p>Elaine: (looking 
              VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.</p>
            <p>Jerry: George?</p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>Elaine: (looking 
              guiltier) No, no&#133;no.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Well, I 
              was here, that&#146;s everyone (laughing).</p>
            <p>Elaine: (laughing).</p>
            <p>Jerry: Are those 
              the same shoes as yesterday?</p>
            <p>Elaine: Oh, you 
              know I wear these shoes all the time. </p>
            <p>Jerry: Your hair, 
              it&#146;s somewhat de-poofed. </p>
            <p>Elaine: It&#146;s 
              the new look. You know Heroin Cheek? </p>
            <p>Jerry: Wait a 
              second, what&#146;s going on here?</p>
            <p>Elaine: Nothing, 
              nothing. </p>
            <p>Jerry: (screams).</p>
            <p>Elaine: (screams).</p>
            <p>Jerry: You&#146;re 
              wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!</p>
            <p>Kramer: Hoochie 
              moochie. (haha)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hand it 
              over. Pay up.</p>
            <p>Elaine: No! It&#146;s 
              an isolated, sexual incident. We are <i>not</i> back together!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Then what 
              do you call it? People don&#146;t just bump into each other and 
              have sex. This isn&#146;t cinemax.</p>
            <p>Elaine: It was 
              no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed 
              a little dinner. </p>
            <p>Jerry: Ah, dinner! 
              That&#146;s it, you&#146;re all the way back!</p>
            <p>Elaine: Ugh!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Sex, that&#146;s 
              meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that&#146;s heavy. 
              That&#146;s like an hour.</p>
            <p>Kramer: (still 
              reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun 
              (Sp?). That was my idea too!</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Play 
              Now)</p>
            <p>George: Good Morning!</p>
            <p>Co-worker: Go 
              to hell!</p>
            <p>George: Hi Allison, 
              that&#146;s a nice dress.</p>
            <p>Allison: Don&#146;t 
              even look at me.</p>
            <p>George: Hey Glenn!</p>
            <p>Glenn: Hey, go 
              tell hell!</p>
            <p>George: Heard 
              that one already.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>(Jerry walks in. 
              Kramer is showing his &quot;intern,&quot; Darren around)</p>
            <p>Kramer: &#133;So 
              that&#146;s the bedroom. Here&#146;s the bathroom. If you need to, 
              you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen&#133;Yeah, go ahead 
              and look through some of the drawers. </p>
            <p>Jerry: And you 
              are?</p>
            <p>Darren: Oh, hey, 
              I&#146;m Darren. I&#146;m new here.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Yeah, 
              that&#146;s Jerry, you don&#146;t have to worry about him. Why don&#146;t 
              you go across the hall and get started on that mail.</p>
            <p>Darren: Right!</p>
            <p>Kramer: He&#146;s 
              a go getter!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Who&#146;s 
              he? </p>
            <p>Kramer: My intern 
              from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Alright.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting 
              some real world corporate experience. </p>
            <p>Jerry: But you 
              only provide fantasy world corporate experience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important 
              things, like my bladder system.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Alright, 
              it&#146;s time to go. </p>
            <p>Kramer: Jerry, 
              it&#146;s not for people, it&#146;s for oil tankers.</p>
            <p>Jerry: (sarcastically) 
              I know!</p>
            <p>(Jerry tries to 
              shove Kramer out the door)</p>
            <p>Kramer: You see 
              the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, 
              the oil won&#146;t spill out.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Actually, 
              that is not a bad idea.</p>
            <p>Kramer: (smiles) 
              yeah.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Now, it&#146;s 
              time to go.</p>
            <p>(slams door)</p>
            <p>(phone rings)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hello</p>
            <p>George: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (He&#146;s sitting on the floor in his Play 
              Now office).</p>
            <p>Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what&#146;s going on?</p>
            <p>George:   Siege mentality   Jerry. They really want me out of here. They&#146;ve 
              downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I&#146;m like Hitler&#146;s 
           last days here.</p>
            <p>Jerry: So, are 
              you going to leave?</p>
            <p>George: Oh no! 
              I&#146;m vigilant. They&#146;ll never get me out. I&#146;m like 
              a weed, Jerry.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I thought 
              you&#146;re like Hitler in the bunker?</p>
            <p>George: I&#146;m 
              a weed in Hitler&#146;s bunker.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I&#146;m 
              getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other 
              line beeps) I&#146;m getting another call, see ya&#133;(answers 
              call) Hello!</p>
            <p>Darren: Hi, this 
              is Darren from Kramer&#146;s office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule 
              a lunch with you at Monk&#146;s coffee shop.</p>
            <p>Jerry: (looking 
              shocked) Really? When?</p>
            <p>Darren: In 10 
              minutes. Do you need directions?</p>
            <p>Jerry: No, I don&#146;t.</p>
            <p>Darren: Well, 
              I&#146;ll call back in 5 minutes to confirm. </p>
            <p>Kramer: Yeah, 
              5.</p>
            <p>(Elaine walks 
              in &#150; again, how did she get up without the buzzer?)</p>
            <p>Elaine: Hey!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey! So, 
              where&#146;s my money?</p>
            <p>Elaine: No money, 
              I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh yeah, 
              hold on.</p>
            <p>(Jerry calls Kramer 
              and Darren answers)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hello Darren, 
              this is Jerry from Jerry&#146;s office. (Elaine is looking confused). 
              We&#146;re going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking 
              confused) What do you mean he&#146;s already left?</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey, Elaine 
              is going to come with us, alright?</p>
            <p>Kramer: What? 
              When did this happen?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Well, just&#133;</p>
            <p>Kramer: (yelling) 
              DARREN!</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>(Sitting on the 
              couch thinking to herself)</p>
            <p>Elaine: I am <i>not</i> 
              calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them 
              over at Puddy&#146;s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, 
              I better not. I&#146;ll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! 
              There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. 
              That&#146;s funny. That&#146;s really funny. That&#146;s really 
              really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks 
              up phone).</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Monk&#146;s 
              Cafe)</p>
            <p>George: Well, 
              Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. 
              They tried to sweat me out.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Do you 
              have to write <i>all</i> this stuff down.</p>
            <p>Darren: Well, 
              Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didn&#146;t want 
              to miss anything.</p>
            <p>Jerry: So, how 
              hot did it get?</p>
            <p>George: I don&#146;t 
              know, 120, 130&#133;Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 
              hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos. </p>
            <p>Jerry: I guess 
              you can take anything, but actual work.</p>
            <p>George: Bring 
              it on!</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>George: (doing 
<!-- BeginAd02 --><!-- EndAd -->
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!</p>
            <p>Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!</p>
            <p>George: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Sorry 
              I couldn&#146;t get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his &quot;intern&quot;)</p>
            <p>Darren: Well, 
              after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether 
              or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and 
              his iron suit&#133;</p>
            <p>Kramer: Uh huh&#133;</p>
            <p>George: (Interrupts) 
              And I still say he&#146;s naked under there!</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh that 
              makes a lot of sense.</p>
            <p>George: Oh, shut 
              up!</p>
            <p>Darren: &#133;Then 
              Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped 
              ice out of Mr. Seinfeld&#146;s drink with his bare hands using it 
              to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then 
              Mr. Costanza remarked to me, &quot;This never happened.&quot; (Jerry 
              then spits out the water).</p>
            <p>(George is looking 
              pissed off)</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment in his bed)</p>
            <p>Jerry: (giggling)</p>
            <p>Clare: What&#146;s 
              so funny?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh, nothing. 
              (still giggling)</p>
            <p>Clare: What are 
              you laughing about? Tell me.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh all 
              right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We&#146;ve been doing 
              this silly, dumb voice.</p>
            <p>(Clare storms 
              out of the room mad!)</p>
            <p>Clare: So is it 
              fun humiliating me?</p>
            <p>Jerry: No, it&#146;s 
              not you. It&#146;s your stomach, he&#146;s taking with this funny, 
              booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.</p>
            <p>Clare: So you 
              think I&#146;m fat?</p>
            <p>Jerry: No it&#146;s&#133;</p>
            <p>(Darren walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>Darren: Mr. Kramer 
              says, &quot;hey buddy!&quot;</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey, we&#146;re 
              kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back 
              later?</p>
            <p>Darren: Oh yeah 
              sure, sure. Should we set something up now?</p>
            <p>Jerry: (Screams) 
              GET OUT!</p>
            <p>Clare: I&#146;m 
              leaving too.</p>
            <p>Jerry: No body 
              said you&#146;re fat. He&#146;s a loving character, like the Kool-ade 
              guy.</p>
            <p>Clare: <i>He</i> 
              is fat!</p>
            <p>Jerry: No, he&#146;s 
              just a little bloated.</p>
            <p>Clare: Good-bye!</p>
            <p>Jerry: It&#146;s 
              mostly water weight.</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Boysenberry, 
              the kid is still learning.</p>
            <p>(Darren is standing 
              in the hallway on the phone)</p>
            <p>Darren: Mr. Kramer&#133;Dean, 
              my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Yeah, 
              well nothing before noon.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Line two?</p>
            <p>Kramer: Yeah, 
              your phone is line one.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Oh&#133;</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>Puddy: So the 
              gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.</p>
            <p>Elaine: See, this 
              is what Jerry&#146;s doesn&#146;t understand. We can see each other. 
              We can see each other every day, but it doesn&#146;t mean we are 
              back together.</p>
            <p>Puddy: I mean 
              I love just seeing you and having sex.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Yeah.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Not having 
              to do all that&#133;you know&#133;work.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Well, 
              either way&#133;</p>
            <p>Puddy: All that 
              calling you, and buying you stuff&#133;</p>
            <p>Elaine: David&#133;</p>
            <p>Puddy: Caring 
              about how everyone at work isn&#146;t as smart as you. It&#146;s 
              brutal.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Alright 
              that&#146;s it! We&#146;re back together!</p>
            <p>Puddy: Oh, no.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Oh, yeah.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Look Elaine, 
              be reasonable.</p>
            <p>(Elaine kisses 
              Puddy)</p>
            <p>Elaine: Get those 
              clothes off. You&#146;re going to spend the night and we&#146;re 
              going to cuddle.</p>
            <p>Puddy: What?</p>
            <p>Elaine: You heard 
              me. Strip!</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Play 
              Now)</p>
            <p>(George is walking 
              in the hallway to his office. He sees his office has been boarded 
              up)</p>
            <p>George: (whistling)&#133;.(laughing)&#133;.Alright&#133;&#133;OK&#133;.</p>
            <p>(George goes through 
              air vent &#150; in his office)</p>
            <p>George: (on phone 
              &#150; calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are 
              you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message 
              for me? &#133;Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) I&#146;M IN 
              MY OFFICE! Thanks.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At NYU)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Dean Jones, 
              you wanting to talk to me?</p>
            <p>Dean Jones: I&#146;ve 
              been reviewing Darren&#146;s internship journal. Doing laundry&#133;</p>
            <p>Kramer: &#133;Yeah.</p>
            <p>Dean Jones: &#133;Mending 
              chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman.</p>
            <p>Kramer: I know 
              it sounds pretty glamorous, but it&#146;s business as usual at Kramerica. 
              </p>
            <p>Dean Jones: As 
              far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary 
              man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.</p>
            <p>Kramer: And with 
              Darren&#146;s help, we&#146;ll get that chicken.</p>
            <p>Dean Jones: I&#146;m 
              sorry, but we can&#146;t allow Darren to continue working with you.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.</p>
            <p>Dean Jones: You 
              fly is open.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>(Jerry &amp; Clare 
              are talking by the doorway)</p>
            <p>Jerry: So you&#146;re 
              sure you&#146;re not still angry about last night?</p>
            <p>Clare: No, I&#146;m 
              fine. Just as long as you don&#146;t ever do that voice again.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Never?</p>
            <p>Clare: Never.</p>
            <p>Jerry: What about 
              if you&#146;re not around?</p>
            <p>Clare: No!</p>
            <p>Jerry: So I have 
              to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?</p>
            <p>Clare: That&#146;s 
              right.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I can do 
              that.</p>
            <p>Clare: So what&#146;s 
              your decision?</p>
            <p>Jerry: I don&#146;t 
              know.</p>

              beach)</p>

              about all the times him and Clare spent together. He&#146;s trying

              on Clare&#146;s door)</p>

            <p>George: You broke 
              up with her? Why?</p>
            <p>Jerry: So we could 
              do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What&#146;s the matter?</p>
            <p>George: I think 
              I&#146;m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? 
              La-la-la?</p>
            <p>Jerry: No, it 
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
              can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.</p>
            <p>George: I think 
              I like the girl better than the voice.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Really?</p>
            <p>(Elaine walks 
              in &#150; how does she keep getting up without that buzzer?!)</p>
            <p>Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Still?</p>
            <p>George: I told 
              you.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Alright, 
              here you go, choke on it (hands him money).</p>
            <p>Jerry: See, never 
              bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Yeah, 
              well not for long. I&#146;m breaking up with him.</p>
            <p>Jerry: No, I don&#146;t 
              think so. I&#146;ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. 
              It&#146;s kismet.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Double 
              or nothing.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Done.</p>
            <p>George: (talking 
              from bathroom) Witness?</p>
            <p>Jerry: You&#146;re 
              in there again. </p>
            <p>George: I think 
              Play Now is putting something in my food.</p>
            <p>(Kramer walks 
              in)</p>
            <p>Elaine: Alright, 
              I&#146;m out of here.</p>
            <p>Jerry: What is 
              this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesn&#146;t fit 
              him).</p>
            <p>Kramer: I don&#146;t 
              know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven&#146;t 
              been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. 
              I&#146;m clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Yeah. Nine 
              o&#146;clock.</p>
            <p>Kramer: I was 
              supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.</p>
            <p>Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Good-bye Kramer.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Jerry, 
              buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Really?</p>
            <p>Kramer: So played.</p>
            <p>George: I told 
              you.</p>
            <p>(Scene: Hallway, 
              Darren is knocking on Kramer&#146;s door)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Darren? 
              What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.</p>
            <p>Darren: I don&#146;t 
              care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Kramerica 
              is no more.</p>
            <p>Darren: What about 
              the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime 
              oil spills.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Probably. 
              Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.</p>
            <p>(Kramer slams 
              door)</p>
            <p>(Kramer opens 
              door)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              you&#146;re still here?</p>
            <p>Darren: I haven&#146;t 
              had time to leave.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              I haven&#146;t changed my mind.</p>
            <p>(Kramer slams 
              door)</p>
            <p>(Kramer opens 
              door)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I&#146;ll do it. Kramerica 
              industries lives! Let&#146;s get back to work!</p>
            <p>(Kramer slams 
              door)</p>
            <p>(Kramer opens 
              door)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Let&#146;s 
              see what Jerry has to eat.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Play 
              Now &#150; in the bosses office)</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: You 
              win George. We&#146;ve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now 
              will give you six months pay. That&#146;s half of your entire contract. 
              Please&#133;just go.</p>
            <p>George: You see 
              if I stay the whole year, I get it all.</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: Want 
              to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play 
              Now employees, George Costanza&#146;s handicapped bathroom is now 
              open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.</p>
            <p>George: Well played.</p>
            <p>Thomassoulo: I&#146;ll 
              see you in hell Costanza.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>Jerry: (on the 
              phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our 
              relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. 
              Hold on one second. (George walks in &#150; Jerry asks George) So 
              we definitely don&#146;t want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes 
              his head NO) Alright, we&#146;re back together again, great. Bye 
              bye.</p>
            <p>(Scene: Hallway 
              &#150; Kramer &amp; Darren are pushing an oil tank.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Hey.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Trouble 
              down at the plant?</p>
            <p>Kramer: It&#146;s 
              a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder 
              system.</p>
            <p>George: You have 
              to drink that whole thing?</p>
            <p>Kramer: No. No. 
              No. It&#146;s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort 
              of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or 
              not it can restrain the impact.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I understand 
              (not really understanding, lol).</p>
            <p>George: Would 
              a giant rubber ball work?</p>
            <p>Kramer: Conceivably.</p>
            <p>George: Well, 
              Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don&#146;t 
              we test your bladder system at my office?</p>
            <p>Jerry: You&#146;re 
              not&#133;</p>
            <p>George: Oh, yes 
              I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there&#146;s nothing 
              dirtier than a giant ball of oil.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Monk&#146;s 
              Cafe)</p>
            <p>Puddy: Hey, you 
              want to split a root beer (I think that&#146;s what he says)?</p>
            <p>Elaine: I don&#146;t 
              think so David, we&#146;re through.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Oh&#133;That&#146;s 
              a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s 
              house &#150; the two are in bed)</p>
            <p>Elaine: Whew that 
              was a dozy.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>(Elaine throws 
              down money on the table).</p>
            <p>Jerry: Go again?</p>
            <p>Elaine: Book it.</p>
            <p>George: (again 
              from bathroom) Witness.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>Elaine: David 
              I know this hurts, but it&#146;s the way it has to be (Puddy is 
              giving her a look like he&#146;s going to still get some).</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>(Elaine is placing 
              money on the table one by one)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Ha ha ha. 
              Ha ha ha ha. </p>
            <p>(Scene: Jerry 
              and Elaine at the movies)</p>
            <p>Elaine: I&#146;m 
              going to get some popcorn. </p>
            <p>(Scene: At Jerry&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>(Elaine hands 
              Jerry money)</p>
            <p>Elaine: So, how 
              did it end?</p>
            <p>Jerry: They got 
              away.</p>
            <p>Elaine: uh.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s 
              apartment)</p>
            <p>Elaine: Listen 
              David, I&#146;ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Play 
              Now)</p>
            <p>(Darren &amp; 
              Kramer are pushing the ball of oil &#150; Jerry walks in)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Hey.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Did you 
              bring the video camera?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Yeah, I 
              put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, 
              and most of your trial. Alright, I&#146;ll see ya.</p>
            <p>George: Oh, you 
              might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong 
              man to hire because he was fake handicapped.</p>
<!-- BeginAd04 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>Jerry: I can&#146;t. 
              I got to meet Clare.</p>
            <p>Kramer: You gave 
              up the voice?</p>
            <p>Jerry: Yeah, I 
              thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.</p>
            <p>Kramer &amp; George: 
              No. No</p>
            <p>Jerry: Darren?</p>
            <p>Darren: Sorry 
              Mr. Seinfeld.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Uh, bathroom.</p>
            <p>George: Hey, use 
              mine. I&#146;ll let you in.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I thought 
              it was open to the public.</p>
            <p>George: I uh, 
              took care of that.</p>
            <p>(Both go to the 
              bathroom, which looks really nice)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Wow! Zanadu 
              . No wonder you&#146;re putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) 
              May I?</p>
            <p>George: I insist. 
              I&#146;ll fix us a drink. (phone rings &#150; who would that be?) 
              I got it.</p>
            <p>(Back to Kramer 
              &amp; Darren in George&#146;s office)</p>
            <p>Kramer: Whew. 
              You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago 
              that some day I&#146;d be standing here about to solve the worlds 
              energy problems, I would&#146;ve said you&#146;re crazy&#133; Now 
              let&#146;s push this giant ball of oil out the window.</p>
            <p>(Back in the bathroom)</p>
            <p>George: So, check 
              out my view.</p>
            <p>Jerry: Wow! Hey, 
              there&#146;s Clare. I better go down.</p>
            <p>George: Hey, there&#146;s 
              Kramer &amp; Darren.</p>
            <p>Jerry: There&#146;s 
              the giant ball of oil. Clare&#146;s right underneath that thing. 
              Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!</p>
            <p>Clare: I don&#146;t 
              believe this. I am <i>not</i> looking up if you&#146;re going to 
              do that voice.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Bombs 
              away (Uh oh).</p>
            <p>Jerry: This is 
              going to be a shame.</p>
            <p>(SPLAT!)</p>
            <p>George: Hello.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Well, 
              that didn&#146;t work. Hey, how about this&#133;ketchup and mustard 
              in the same bottle? </p>
            <p>Darren: Oh that 
              sounds interesting sir.</p>
            <p>Kramer: Yeah.</p>
            <p>(Police sirens 
              &#150; uh oh)</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Monk&#146;s 
              Caf)</p>
            <p>Jerry: Clare won 
              her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. 
              I guess you&#146;re not going in anymore. </p>
            <p>George: Yeah.</p>
            <p>Jerry: So they&#146;re 
              not paying you your&#133;</p>
            <p>George: No.</p>
            <p>Jerry: So you&#146;re 
              pretty much&#133;</p>
            <p>George: Yeah.</p>
            <p>Jerry: What ever 
              happened to Darren?</p>
            <p>Kramer: Darren 
              is going away for a long long time. </p>
            <p>Jerry: So Clare 
              sure looked real funny covered in oil like that&#133; (doing the 
              voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil&#133;</p>
            <p>George: (doing 
              the voice) I&#146;m slippery as an eel&#133;</p>
            <p>Kramer: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.</p>
            <p>Jerry: I&#146;m 
              just so glad it&#146;s back.</p>
            <p>(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s 
              apartment in bed with Puddy AGAIN)</p>
            <p>Elaine: See, this 
              is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling 
              ourselves. We belong together.</p>
            <p>Puddy: Elaine: 
              I want to break up.</p>
            <p>Elaine: Ah nuts!</p>
