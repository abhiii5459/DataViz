      INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY</p>
            <p>The gang drives along in Jerry's car with the top down. Elaine 
              and Kramer sit in the back, George is shotgun, and Jerry behind 
              the wheel. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Man, I'm starving.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with 
              the ball and the rubber band.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of 
              those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before 
              that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. </p>
            <p>JERRY: I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of 
              the game.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting 
              shellacked.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Those nachos are killing me.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I thought you were hungry.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's complicated.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Keep your shirt on. I got it.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Watch out for that maroon Golf.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, boy.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- 
              now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! 
              Jerry! Go--ahh...</p>
            <p>Jerry swerves into another lane. Lamar, the driver of the maroon 
              Golf honks the horn.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He 
              accelerated.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your 
              window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, no, I couldn't do that.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, all right.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah.</p>
            <p>Elaine and Kramer get up to moon Lamar.</p>
            <p>INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY</p>
            <p>GEORGE: So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, yeah. What's that called?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.</p>
            <p>JERRY: How was it?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg 
              flights that made it.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning 
              debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles 
              over the airfield, I yelled out, &quot;That's gotta hurt!&quot;</p>
            <p>JERRY: Heh.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: The place went nuts.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled 
              that out at the actual disaster.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Why are we slowing down?</p>
            <p>Music plays in the background.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What is that music?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: What's with all these flags?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, no.</p>
            <p>ELAINE AND JERRY: It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let 
              anyone through.</p>
            <p>We're never getting home.</p>
            <p>Kramer stands up on the back seat.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>STOCK FOOTAGE: Puerto Rican Day parade.</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY STREET - DAY</p>
            <p>Kramer runs along the sidewalk and hops into the back seat of a 
              black Saab.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think 
              every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.</p>
            <p>There is a Puerto Rican family in the car.</p>
            <p>PUERTO RICAN MAN: Well, it is our day.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.</p>
            <p>Kramer hops out.</p>
            <p>INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY</p>
            <p>Still sitting stopped in traffic are Elaine, Jerry, and George. 
              They are listening to the radio.</p>
            <p>RADIO: And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.</p>
            <p>JERRY: See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have 
              calmed down the nachos.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 
              60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. 
              It makes me anxious.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can 
              get out over there.</p>
            <p>JERRY: But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how 
              am I gonna get all the way over there?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Just inch over. You worm your way.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You know, you should make yourself throw up.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Huh?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You know you're going to.</p>
            <p>JERRY: All right, I'm worming.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? 
              None other than Miss Chita Rivera.</p>
            <p>JERRY: They're not letting me in.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: My hand is out.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have 
              to see a human face.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: You sure you want his face?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.</p>
            <p>JERRY: The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Look at me! I am man! I am you!</p>
            <p>The man in the other car looks over at George. Elaine, sitting 
              behind George, aids in the cause by pleading to the man by mouthing 
              the words, &quot;Hi, can we go in?&quot;</p>
            <p>GEORGE: All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.</p>
            <p>JERRY: One more lane to go.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: All right! We're here!</p>
            <p>Just as Jerry is about to enter the one-way street, Lamar and his 
              maroon Golf cut him off.</p>
            <p>LAMAR: Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Maroon Golf.</p>
            <p>LAMAR: Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Could you move your car back a little?</p>
            <p>LAMAR: Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am 
              going somewhere else.</p>
            <p>Elaine pushes George's seat forward slamming his head onto the 
              dashboard. She gets out.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya 
              con dios.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Con dios? Well, that's rude.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Can you believe her?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yeah. I'll see you later.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Where are you going?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: The movies. Blimp is playing right there.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid 
              line?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.</p>
            <p>JERRY: That's not what I do.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Isn't it?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.</p>
            <p>George leaves.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that 
              big in a while.</p>
            <p>STOCK FOOTAGE: Taxis stuck in traffic.</p>
            <p>INT. TAXI CAB - DAY</p>
            <p>Elaine sits in the back.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped 
              inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? </p>
            <p>She moves so she can yell out the driver's open window.</p>
            <p>ELAINE (yelling): Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!</p>
            <p>She leans back.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.</p>
            <p>CAB DRIVER: No, you can't.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here. </p>
            <p>She pays her fare and gets out.</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p>She starts to walk. The cab starts to move.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!</p>
            <p>The cab stops and she gets back in.</p>
            <p>INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p>CAB DRIVER: Where to?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. 
              Bye again.</p>
            <p>She pays and gets out again.</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p>Again, the cab starts moving when she gets out.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey. Taxi! Taxi!</p>
            <p>She starts to run after the taxi which starts to move faster.</p>
            <p>INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY</p>
            <p>George sits down next to two attractive women.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.</p>
            <p>LADY 1: What is that dot?</p>
            <p>LADY 2: Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers.</p>
            <p>A red laser moves around the movie screen. Everyone laughs as the 
              dot rests on the breasts of the movie actress.</p>
            <p>INT. MOVIE LOBBY - DAY</p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>The laser pointer guy uses his laser to point at a box of Skittles 
              and RC Cola.</p>
            <p>LASER GUY: Gimme a box of those and one of those.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?</p>
            <p>LASER GUY: The laser's not funny. I'm funny.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of 
              my own I wanted to try.</p>
            <p>LASER GUY: Uh-huh. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave 
              me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed 
              with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...</p>
            <p>INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY</p>
            <p>Kramer and Jerry sit listening to the radio.</p>
            <p>RADIO What a comeback for the New York Mets-- 6 runs in the bottom 
              of the ninth.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we 
              could get out of here.</p>
            <p>LAMAR: This traffic's a killer, ain't it?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave 
              the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number 
              off the engine block, and we walk away.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Walk away?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, 
              and then you get another one free.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Isn't there a deductible?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: All right, what is your deductible?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I don't know.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yes, because they've already deducted it.</p>
            <p>JERRY: From what?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you 
              pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.</p>
            <p>JERRY: We're not leaving the car!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance 
              company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Absolutely not. He sped up.</p>
            <p>RADIO: Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in

            <p>LADY 2: He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.</p>
            <p>LADY 1: I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me 
              than looks or hair.</p>
            <p>LADY 2: Mmm, yeah.</p>
            <p>There's an explosion on the screen. The laser moves around the 
              screen and everyone laughs.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: That's gotta hurt!</p>
            <p>Everyone stops laughing.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!</p>
            <p>George stands up.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow 
              laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The laser guy points the laser at George's head.</p>
            <p>LADY 1: Look! It's on the bald guy.</p>
            <p>LADY 2: I am so glad we came to this showing.</p>

              cut him off with an &quot;I am sorry&quot; wave.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What's that?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You raise the hand, lower the head-- &quot;I'm sorry, I'm 
              sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand 
              it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!&quot; You get my drift.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Ok!</p>
            <p>Jerry puts both hands up over his head and does the &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; 
              wave.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>LAMAR: Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can 
              get out now.</p>
            <p>Kramer gets in the car. George shows up and climbs into the back 
              seat.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What's that on your forehead?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: It's probably chocolate.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!</p>
            <p>JERRY: See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an 
              &quot;I'm not sorry&quot; wave.</p>
            <p>LAMAR: What was that?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, 
              jackass! </p>
            <p>As Jerry pulls into the one way street, a taxi comes down the street 
              and blocks him in. In the taxi is Elaine.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Elaine?!</p>

              everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?</p>

              you knew the way to go! You went to college!</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't 
              talk to me about hardship.</p>
            <p>She pays the driver and gets out.</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY STREET - DAY</p>
            <p>Elaine walks up to Jerry.</p>

              We were almost out!</p>
            <p>LAMAR: So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's 
              real good.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, 
              but not anymore.</p>

            <p>ELAINE: All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's 
              a sniper lookin' to pop ya.</p>
            <p>Elaine leaves. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. 
              What if it hits my eye?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I don't know.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the

            <p>Elaine picks up a nylon flap that covers the sides of some bleachers.</p>
            <p>OLDER MAN: Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea.</p>

            <p>SALES WOMAN: The asking price is $1.5 million.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell 
              men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall 
              grotto?</p>
            <p>SALES WOMAN: No.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: How about a bathroom?</p>

            <p>GEORGE: The side?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your 
              cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more 
              intense, until finally-</p>

            <p>KRAMER: See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Kramer smells the smoke, turns, and sees the fire.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Ooh! !Dios mio!</p>
            <p>He grabs the flag, throws it onto the sidewalk and stops on it.</p>
            <p>MAN: Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!</p>
            <p>BOB: Who! Who is burning the flag?!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, no.</p>
            <p>BOB: Him?!</p>
            <p>CEDRIC: That's not very nice.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: It was an accident.</p>
            <p>BOB: Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this 
              is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what 
              day this is!</p>
            <p>CEDRIC: Because it's Puerto Rican day.</p>
            <p>BOB: Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do 
              you think of that?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!</p>
            <p>Kramer runs off screaming. The others give chase.</p>
            <p>INT. APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p>The sales woman lets George in.</p>
            <p>SALES WOMAN: Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna 
              go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably 
              one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?</p>
            <p>SALES WOMAN: It's down the hall.</p>
            <p>George walks to the bathroom, but stops when he sees Jerry.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, hello...</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Art.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Mr. Vandelay, of course.</p>
            <p>SALES WOMAN: You two know each other?</p>
            <p>Kramer bursts through the door.</p>
            <p>SALES WOMAN: Mr. Pennypacker!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure 
              that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.</p>
            <p>SALES WOMAN: Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know 
              Mr. Varnsen </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh, Varnsen.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Pennypacker.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Vandelay.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Pennypacker. Varnsen.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, 
              and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: The factory?</p>
            <p>JERRY: The Saab factory?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Jerry, that's in Sweden.</p>
            <p>George turns on the TV as Jerry runs to the window just in time 
              to see a mob attacking his car.</p>
            <p>JERRY: My car!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Jerry, the Mets lost.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I love a parade!</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Jerry's car is stuck in a stairwell outside a building. Kramer, 
              George, and Jerry admire the mob's handiwork.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: How do you suppose they did that?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, 
              shall we go home?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, what about my car?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.</p>
            <p>Elaine approaches the group. She is totally disheveled with popcorn 
              in her hair and her clothing stained.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, there's Elaine.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, you look, uh...relaxed.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.</p>
            <p>Lamar drives up in his maroon Golf.</p>
            <p>LAMAR: Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha 
              ha ha! See ya around!</p>
            <p>He drives off.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, at least he didn't-</p>
            <p>LAMAR: Jackass!</p>
            <p>Jerry sets his car alarm.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Somebody remember where we parked.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.</p>
            <p>The foursome walk off as a laser lights up George's rear end.</p>
