        instructions.<br>
        <br>

        one, Jesus<br>
        is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall...&quot; Elaine changes the stations 
        but all<br>
        of the presets are set to religious radio stations; &quot;And he said 
        unto<br>
        Abraham...&quot;, &quot;Amen! Amen!&quot;, &quot;So we pray...&quot;, 
        &quot;Saved!&quot;, &quot;Jey-sus!&quot; She turns<br>

        New scene.<br>
        Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.<br>
        <br>
        Kruger: According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing 
        is<br>
        heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?<br>
        <br>
        George: Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off 
        my rent<br>
        check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.<br>
        <br>
        Kruger: Works for me. Good thinking, George.<br>
        <br>
        Co-worker 1: Alright, George.<br>
        <br>
        Co-worker 2: Way to go man.<br>
        <br>
        George: Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend<br>
        we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. &quot;Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Kruger: Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.<br>
        <br>
        Co-worker 1: Good one.<br>
        <br>
        Co-worker 2: That was bad.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        New scene.<br>
        George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.<br>
        <br>
        George: I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.<br>
        <br>
        JerrY: And then?<br>
        <br>
        George: I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during 
        a<br>
        meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight 
        and<br>
        walk off.<br>
        <br>
        George: I can't just leave.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: That's the way they do it in Vegas.<br>
        <br>
        George: You never played Vegas.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: I hear things.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine enters and has a seat.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his 
        radio<br>
        were Christian rock stations.<br>
        <br>
        George: I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those 
        real<br>
        musicians who think they're so cool and hip.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Yes, he is lazy.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Yes, he is dumb.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Dumb and lazy, I understand.<br>
        <br>
        George: Tell you how you could check.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: How?<br>
        <br>
        George: Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? 
        The<br>
        old switcheroo.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch 
        it<br>
        with the other person's.<br>
        <br>
        George: No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the 
        radio<br>
        did to her.<br>
        <br>
        George: Well that's the gist of it!<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Quiet! So where is this Sophie?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: How long have you two been together?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?<br>
        <br>
        Elaine and George: Nah.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry leaves to go meet Sophie by the register.<br>
        <br>
        George: By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: I needed to move a bureau.<br>

        New scene.<br>
        Kramer and Mickey enter Jerry's apartment.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?<br>
        <br>
        Mickey: Hey Jerry.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should<br>
        sound like that, something like that.<br>
        <br>
        Mickey: Aah-choo.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: What's with the fake sneezing?<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors 
        to<br>
        help the students practice diagnosing.<br>
        <br>
        Mickey: They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. 
        It's<br>
        an easy gig.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Do medical schools actually do this?<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer and Mickey: HUAAHHH!!<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: I think the phone is ringing.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer and Mickey: HUAAHHH!!<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here 
        with<br>
        that stuff?<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Mickey, DTs.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer and Mickey exit, shaking, while Jerry answers the phone.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Hello?<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: Hey. It's me.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Elaine?<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: No, it's me.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: George??<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer enters.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: You got any Ipecac?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with 
        this.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Did he overdose?<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: No, it's just too much.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        New scene.<br>
        Office meeting at Kruger Industrial Smoothing.<br>
        <br>
        Kruger: ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette<br>
        Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the 
        size of<br>
        a softball, and that spells trouble.<br>
        <br>
        George: Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick 
        a<br>
        pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?<br>
        <br>
        Everyone at the meeting breaks out in laughter.<br>
        <br>
        George (getting up and leaving): Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight<br>
        everybody.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        New scene.<br>
        Mt. Sanai Hospital, a woman in a lab coat is handing out envelopes to 
        a group of<br>
        people, Mickey and Kramer included.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Wexler: In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned 
        and<br>
        the symptoms you will need to exhibit.<br>
        <br>
        Mickey: Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?<br>
        <br>
        Mickey: Sorry buddy, this is the &quot;Hamlet&quot; of diseases. Severe 
        pain, nausea,<br>
        delusions, it's got everything.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer (to the man beside him): Howbout you, do you wanna trade?<br>
        <br>
        Man: Sure.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Okay, what do you got?<br>
        <br>
        Man: The surgeon left a sponge inside me.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Good luck with that.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        New scene.<br>
        George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.<br>
        <br>
        George: I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was 
        gone.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: What did you do the rest of the day?<br>
        <br>
        George: I saw &quot;Titanic&quot;. So that old woman, she's just a liar, 
        right?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine enters.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Hello boys.<br>
        <br>
        George: Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: I did.<br>
        <br>
        George: And the Christian rock?<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus 
        fish!<br>
        <br>
        George: Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel<br>
        misled.<br>
        <br>
        George: I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the &quot;It's me&quot; on 
        the phone today.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: &quot;It's me?&quot; Isn't it a little premature?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: I thought so.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Hah. She's not a &quot;me&quot;. I'm a &quot;me&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        George: I'm against all &quot;it's me&quot;s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, 
        it's<br>
        like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!<br>
        <br>
        Kramer enters.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Well, I got gonorrhea.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: That seems about right.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: That's what they gave me.<br>
        <br>
        George: They? The Government?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can 
        diagnose<br>
        it.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, 
        he<br>
        got bacterial meningitis.<br>
        <br>
        George: I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.<br>

        The other three start laughing.<br>

        George (leaving): Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.<br>

        Elaine: What was that?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the 
        back<br>

        Student #1: And are you experiencing any discomfort?<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Just a little burning during urination.<br>
        <br>
        Student #1: Okay, any other pain?<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) 
        <br>
        Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes 
        met<br>
        across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. 
        <br>
        Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so 
        we<br>
        danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that 
        I would<br>
        experience soon afterwards.<br>
        <br>
        Student #1: Gonorrhea?!<br>

        George: What the hell is a gander, anyway?<br>

        Jerry (picking up the phone and dialing): It's a goose that's had the

        <br>
        Sophie: Hey Raef.<br>

        Jerry: No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. 
        We're<br>
        dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.<br>
        <br>
        George: Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: No, she looks completely normal.<br>
        <br>
        George: Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor<br>
        accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: You think she's got toes for thumbs?<br>
        <br>
        George: How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too<br>

        the doughtnuts and--<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: I'm not in the mood.<br>

        George (To a passing waitress): I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: What do you care? You don't believe in hell.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: I know, but he does.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination 
        of<br>
        your soul.<br>
        <br>
        Elaine: Well, relationships are very important to me.<br>

        burn for<br>
        all eternity.<br>

        they should change it to a tractor.<br>

        about<br>
        it.<br>
        <br>
        George: I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her

        Jerry: She doesn't have toe thumbs.<br>

        Jerry: Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?<br>
        <br>
        George: Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for<br>
        hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with 
        sleep<br>
        creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was 
        that he<br>
        finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around,

        <br>
        Jerry: Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with 
        it.<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: How could you know?<br>
        <br>
        Jerry (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back 
        to<br>
        Sopie's): Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not<br>
        gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term 
        and<br>
        meaningful relationship.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer and Mickey barge in, they're in the middle of an argument.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: ...I didn't say that, no.<br>
        <br>
        Mickey: You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd 
        have fun<br>
        with it.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: Hey, hey! I'm with someone.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: Oh. Hello.<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The<br>
        important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.<br>
        <br>
        Kramer (to Mickey): You know? She's right.<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a<br>
        tractor.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry: You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor<br>
        story??<br>
        <br>
        Kramer: You can't get it from that.<br>
        <br>
        Sophie: But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor<br>
        in my bathing suit.<br>
        <br>
        Jerry (walking out): Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight<br>
        everybody.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        New scene.<br>
        Mr. Kruger and George are burning the midnight oil. George is working, 
        Mr.<br>
        Kruger is bouncing a ball against the wall and catching it. George is<br>
        percolating.<br>
        <br>
        George: Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kruger: You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.<br>
        <br>
        George: No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your<br>
        name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off 
        and<br>
        all it says now is K-uger!<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kruger: K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, 
        huh? <br>
        K-uger! K-uger!<br>
        <br>
        George: Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kruger (getting up to leave): Thank you George, you've been great. 
        That's<br>
        it for me.<br>
        <br>
        George: Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kruger: It's K-uger!<br>
        <br>
        George: No! No!<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kruger: Goodnight everybody!<br>
        <br>
