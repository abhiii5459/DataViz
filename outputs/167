            <p>Written by: Steve Koren</p>
            <p>Directed by: Andy Ackerman</p>
            <p>Broadcasted: January 8, 1998 for the first time.</p>
            <p>Stars: Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, </p>
            <p>Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Joel McCrary (as Don), and 
              Patrick</p>
            <p>Warburton (as Puddy).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>[Setting: A car dealership]</p>
            <p>(Jerry and George are looking over some cars)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was 
              right around the corner.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: No. That's just electric.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. 
              That was a cool one.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Sarcastic) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang 
              Bang?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, what do you think the big holdup is? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: The government is very touchy about us being in the air. 
              Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in 
              the air is a big production. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: And the underwater bubble cities? </p>
            <p>JERRY: It's like we're living in the '50s here. </p>
            <p>(Kramer&#146;s bouncing up and down on the rear bumper of one of 
              the cars for sale)</p>
            <p>KRAMER: It's good suspension! </p>
            <p>JERRY: (To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time 
              to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. 
              (Gestures to a black Saab) </p>
            <p>GEORGE: What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the 
              car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know 
              why you're here. </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Talking about the vein in George&#146;s head) There's that 
              vein again. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: I'm starving. We should have had lunch first.. </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I 
              told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought 
              he was a mechanic. </p>
            <p>JERRY: I guess he graduated. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: That's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back 
              to screwin' you right to your face. </p>
            <p>(Kramer, in one of the cars, honks the horn) </p>
            <p>JERRY: (To Kramer) Thank you. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Puddy&#146;s just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptic) 
              You&#146;ll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, 
              dealer prep. Sudeenly, you&#146;re</p>
            <p>on your back like a turnip. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Alright. Calm down. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him 
              up real nice. Next thing I know, I&#146;m gettin&#146; dropped of 
              in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All</p>
            <p>the kids are shoutin&#146; at me, &quot;Hey, Le George! Bonjour, 
              Le George! Let&#146;s stuff Le George in Le Locker!&quot; </p>
            <p>(Kramer&#146;s now on his back, under a car) </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Jerry, I don&#146;t think this thing is hooked up right. 
            </p>
            <p>(Jerry and George go to enter the office buildings) </p>
            <p>JERRY: (To Kramer) Alright, we&#146;re goin&#146; in. </p>
            <p>(A salesman walks up to Kramer. He&#146;s still under the car) 
            </p>
            <p>SALESMAN: You&#146;ve got a good eye, there. I see you&#146;ve 
              noticed the uni-body construction. I&#146;m Rick. Are you looking 
              to buy or lease? </p>
            <p>(Kramer emerges from under the car) </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh, borrow. It&#146;s for my friend. Yeah, he&#146;ll be 
              buying.. </p>
            <p>RICK: Maybe I should talk to him. </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, I don&#146;t think so. No, he&#146;s an entertainer. 
              You know, all over the place. That&#146;s where I come in. </p>
            <p>RICK: I see. So, you&#146;re his manag-</p>
            <p>(Kramer hops into the car) </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, neighbor. That&#146;s right. Yeah, why don&#146;t 
              we take this boiler out for a shakedown? </p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to the insides of the dealership building. Jerry and 
              George are waiting for a salesman to assist them) </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear 
              is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, &quot;I&#146;ll 
              walk out of here right now!&quot; </p>
            <p>(A salesman approaches) </p>
            <p>SALESMAN: Can I help you with something? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Threatening) Hold it! One more step and we&#146;re walkin&#146;! 
            </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we&#146;re just 
              waiting for David Puddy. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Still with a tone) He is. You don&#146;t know what I&#146;m 
              doin&#146; here. </p>
            <p>(Elaine walks into the showroom with David Puddy) </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Sorry I&#146;m late. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to 
              celebrate his promotion. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Ah. Where&#146;d you go? </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Arby&#146;s. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: I had the roast beef.. </p>
            <p>JERRY: So, Puddy, I decided I&#146;m gonna go with another 900 
              convertible. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Alright. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine 
              is? </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there. 
            </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh. (Leaves for the room) </p>
            <p>PUDDY: (To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I&#146;ll show 
              you the 900. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900. </p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to Kramer. He&#146;s in the car with the salesman, 
              Rick, and they&#146;re driving an unknown street) </p>
            <p>RICK: .. And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock breaks, 
              automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make 
              a right at this corner, please.</p>
            <p>(Goes back to the features) Adjustable steering wheel, and.. Oh, 
              Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..</p>
            <p>KRAMER: No. No, I didn&#146;t. </p>
            <p>RICK: Well, that&#146;s okay. (Pointing) We&#146;ll make this next 
              right, and swing around to get back to the dealership. </p>
            <p>KRAMER: (Up to something) Well, it&#146;s a test drive, right? 
              I never drive around here. If I&#146;m gonna recommend this car, 
              I need to see that it&#146;ll handle my daily</p>
            <p>routine. </p>
            <p>RICK: So where are we going? </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Just a little place I like to call, &quot;You&#146;ll see&quot;. 
            </p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Puddy&#146;s office] </p>
            <p>(George and Jerry are in conference with Puddy) </p>
            <p>GEORGE: I&#146;m starving. You got any of those free donuts you 
              use to soften people up? </p>
            <p>PUDDY: (Pointing out his office door) By the service department.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Getting up, he addresses Jerry) Alright, remember: no 
              rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble. 
            </p>
            <p>JERRY: (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George. 
            </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Don&#146;t think it can&#146;t happen! (Leaves) </p>
            <p>JERRY: So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more 
              &quot;grease monkey&quot;. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: I don&#146;t care for that term. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh. Sorry, I didn&#146;t know.. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: No, I don&#146;t know too many monkeys who could take apart 
              a fuel injector. </p>
            <p>JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah, Koko. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Right, Koko. That chimp&#146;s alright. (Holds up his hand) 
              High-five. </p>
            <p>(Returning, George sees Jerry reluctantly slap hands with Puddy) 
            </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! What&#146;s goin&#146; on here? (To Jerry) 
              You didn&#146;t agree to anything, did ya? </p>
            <p>JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were 
              none left. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: (Standing up) Well, there&#146;s a vending machine. I could 
              show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)</p>
            <p>GEORGE: (To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar. </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Getting a dollar out) Where&#146;s your money? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (Talking it) I&#146;m here helpin&#146; you.</p>
            <p>(Elaine enters) </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey. Where&#146;s Puddy? The copy machine is broken. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. That&#146;s what they want 
              you to think. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed 
              an annoying little habit? </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting? </p>
            <p>JERRY: No. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring? </p>
            <p>JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: I thought all guys do that. </p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>JERRY: Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. 
              In fact, even some of them have moved on - they&#146;re using sign 
              language now. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Is that bad? </p>
            <p>JERRY: What do you think the Nazis were doin&#146;? (Imitates the 
              Nazi&#146;s salute) That was the heil-five. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Pointing out) Isn&#146;t that from your act, like, ten 
              years ago? </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the &#145;80&#146;s, 
              and it&#146;s still relatable today. </p>
            <p>(Puddy approaches them) </p>
            <p>PUDDY: Good news. We got a 900 in black. That&#146;s the hot color. 
              (Holds up his hand) High-five. </p>
            <p>(Elaine and Jerry exchange looks) </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the 
              copy machine? </p>
            <p>(Elaine takes Puddy&#146;s arm, leading him to the room) </p>
            <p>PUDDY: (Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five. </p>
            <p>(Scene ends)</p>
            <p>[Setting: Dealership back room] </p>
            <p>(George is eyeing a Twix candy bar through the vending machine 
              glass) </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5. </p>
            <p>(George put in his dollar, but the machine rejects it. He tries

              now! </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this? </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine! </p>
            <p>(Elaine flinches with every loud banging noise) </p>
            <p>ELAINE: What?! </p>
            <p>JERRY: You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this 
              deal. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Sarcastic) You know, just that you cared enough to call 
              means so much, Jerry. </p>
            <p>JERRY: You&#146;re gonna get back together, anyway. It&#146;s thousands 
              of dollars! </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, I don&#146;t know.. </p>
            <p>JERRY: Come on. Then you don&#146;t have to see him again &#145;til 
              my 15,000-mile check. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Well, will you pay my cab fare out there? </p>
            <p>JERRY: Fine. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: And I didn&#146;t like that roast beef, so how &#145;bout 
              some lunch? </p>
            <p>JERRY: No. No lunch. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: I&#146;ll hang the phone up right now! </p>
            <p>JERRY: Alright! Lunch! </p>
            <p>ELAINE: I&#146;ll see ya. (Hanging up the phone) </p>
            <p>JERRY: Bye. (Hangs up) </p>
            <p>JERRY: (Frustrated, he reacts) Everybody&#146;s ripping me off! 
            </p>
            <p>(Scene cuts to George at the customer complaint window) </p>
            <p>GEORGE: I&#146;d like to report a problem with one of your mechanics. 
            </p>
            <p>WILLIE: When did you bring the car in? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: (To the man behind him in line) Yeah right.. I&#146;m gonna 
              get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don&#146;t I just 
              flush my money down the toilet? </p>
            <p>WILLIE: Sir, what, exactly, is the problem? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix 
              candy bar! </p>
            <p>WILLIE: Are you saying he grabbed the candy bar away from you? 
            </p>
            <p>GEORGE: He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered 
              in chocolate and cookie crumbs. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: I thought you said it was a Twix. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: Maybe it was. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch. 
            </p>
            <p>WILLIE: What about the $100,000 bar? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: No. Rice and caramel. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: Nougat? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: No. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: Positive? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Please. </p>
            <p>(A woman appears from behind the window) </p>
            <p>WOMAN: You know they changed the name from $100,000 bar to 100 
              Grand? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and 
              for him to be fired!</p>
            <p>(An old man sitting in a nearby chair speaks up. He&#146;s Willie&#146;s 
              father) </p>
            <p>WILLIE SR: I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey 
              for a nickel. </p>
            <p>(The man behind George speaks up) </p>
            <p>MAN: What&#146;s the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial! </p>
            <p>WILLIE SR: Not Skittles. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don&#146;t 
              talk. </p>
            <p>WOMAN: (Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all 
              day? </p>
            <p>WILLIE: He likes it! </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Alright! Do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, 
              what are you gonna do about my Twix? </p>
            <p>MAN: (In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut. </p>
            <p>GEORGE: No! There&#146;s no coconut! </p>
            <p>WOMAN: (Behind service window) I&#146;m allergic to coconut. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: I&#146;m not. </p>
            <p>WILLIE SR: ..A nickel! </p>

              is you two getting back together. Eh, then we&#146;ll talk about 
              the car. </p>
            <p>PUDDY: (Like a kid) I don&#146;t want to get back with her. She&#146;s 
              too bossy. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: (Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David.. 
            </p>
            <p>JERRY: Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don&#146;t 
              we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look, 
              you both find each</p>

            <p>RICK: No, no coconut for me. </p>

              bar, as he claimed, wouldn&#146;t you agree he would have no problem 
              picking one out from a</p>

            <p>WILLIE: &quot;Candy line-up&quot;? </p>

              with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select 
              from. </p>
            <p>WILLIE: It took you an hour? </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. 
              And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens
