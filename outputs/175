      INT. MONK'S RESTAURANT - DAY</p>
            <p>George and Jerry sit at their usual booth.</p>
            <p>JERRY (to waitress): Cup of tea with lemon.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: What happened to your voice?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open 
              for a rodeo.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can 
              go with George Costanza.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's 
              got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You mean like...Liza!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: But I was thinking...T-bone.</p>
            <p>JERRY: But there's no &quot;t&quot; in your name. What about G-bone?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: There's no G-bone.</p>
            <p>JERRY: There's a g-spot.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: That's a myth.</p>
            <p>George takes a bite of his sandwich and gets a piece stuck to his 
              chin.</p>
            <p>JERRY: T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.</p>
            <p>EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>

            <p>INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p>Jerry and Elaine are sitting on the sofa chewing gum.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>JERRY: They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama 
              or--</p>
            <p>JERRY: Oh, I had that comin' to me. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: You know, Kenny Rogers has a-</p>
            <p>Jerry's maid exits from his bedroom and walks over to the kitchen.</p>
            <p>ELAINE (whispering): Why did you get a maid?</p>
            <p>JERRY: You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Where did you get her?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I hired her from a service!</p>
            <p>MAID: All done.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Thank you. Nice job.</p>
            <p>MAID: Is this mine?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah.</p>
            <p>The maid leaves Jerry's apartment. Elaine smiles at Jerry.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Notice what? She's not really even a maid.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh.</p>
            <p>JERRY: She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or 
              a...news woman.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.</p>
            <p>Kramer enters.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's 
              movin' away.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You have a girlfriend?</p>
            <p>Jerry stands up; Kramer opens the fridge.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Jerry, where have you been?</p>
            <p>JERRY: At a rodeo. Where's she moving?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Downtown.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Downtown New York?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance 
              relationships.</p>
            <p>JERRY: It's like 10 minutes by subway.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: I don't know.</p>
            <p>Kramer opens a bottled carbonated drink which overflows and spills 
              onto the floor.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different 
              world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's 
              a 646.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What? What is that?</p>
            <p>JERRY: That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all 
              the new numbers are 646.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later 
              and pick up a fax.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: At work?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: No. At your apartment.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I don't have a fax machine.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Here we go. </p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is 
              why you should get a fax and a Xerox.</p>
            <p>JERRY: And a dead bolt.</p>
            <p>KRAMER (to Elaine) Are ya sure you don't have one? Because there's 
              a lot of stuff in my apartment I've never seen.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Then maybe you have a fax machine.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You just blew my mind.</p>

            <p>EXT. KRUGER'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Let's order lunch.</p>
            <p>INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Everyone is gathered around a large conference table.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Mary, I will have a chef's salad.</p>
            <p>MALE WORKER: Turkey sandwich.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: T-bone steak.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: For lunch?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In 
              fact, you might as well call me--</p>
            <p>WATKINS: That sounds good. I'll have one, too.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?</p>
            <p>WATKINS: I love 'em.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Well, then we should call you T-bone.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.</p>

              T-bone! T-bone!</p>
            <p>INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p>The phone rings. Elaine enters her apartment carrying bags of groceries. 
              She drops the bags and picks up the phone.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hello?</p>
            <p>A fax squeal.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What?</p>
            <p>She checks her answering machine.</p>
            <p>MACHINE: You have 57 messages. Message one...</p>
            <p>Fax squeal. She skips to the next message.</p>
            <p>MACHINE: Message two...</p>
            <p>Fax squeal. She skips to the next message.</p>

            <p>She skips to the next message.</p>

            <p>Fax squeal.</p>
            <p>ELAINE Kramer!</p>
            <p>The phone rings. Elaine hesitates and lets it ring. She finally 
              caves and picks it up.</p>
            <p>EALINE: Hello?</p>
            <p>Another fax squeal.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Aah!</p>

            <p>INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well Cindy, the place looks great.</p>
            <p>She grabs her money off the counter.</p>
            <p>CINDY: Thanks Jerry, gotta run.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Ok, I'll see ya.</p>
            <p>As Cindy leaves, Jerry gives her a big kiss. Elaine shows up and 
              watches, amused.</p>
            <p>CINDY: Hi, Elaine.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Jerry groans as Elaine enters and Cindy exits.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is 
              a wise decision.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation 
              so obviously fraught with potential complications?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep 
              with you.</p>
            <p>JERRY: No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What? A health plan?</p>
            <p>JERRY: I was going to say, &quot;Being a good host.&quot;</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh-ho-ho. Oh.</p>
            <p>JERRY: But the point is we have our personal relationship, and 
              we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some 
              what sophisticated.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So you consider this a relationship?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yes, I do. </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh. Have you been out?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yes, we have.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Where did you go?</p>
            <p>JERRY: The store.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Mm! To get what?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Stuff.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Cleaning supplies?</p>
            <p>JERRY: And gum.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' 
              the maid and then chewin' some gum.</p>
            <p>JERRY: She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!</p>
            <p>Kramer enters.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab 
              and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.</p>
            <p>Kramer sits down on the couch.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house 
              every 30 seconds?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're 
              Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the 
              menus from some restaurants.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Which ones?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So this is never gonna stop?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should 
              I pick those up later?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: You can pick 'em up right now.</p>
            <p>Elaine imitates the fax squeal right into Kramer's ear.</p>

            <p>She fondles a candle stick as a phone man fixes her phone.</p>
            <p>ELAINE (thinking): I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just 
              disappeared...would anybody notice?</p>
            <p>PHONE MAN: All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new 
              number.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ahem. 646? What is this?</p>
            <p>PHONE MAN: That's your new area code.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I thought 646 was just for new numbers.</p>
            <p>PHONE MAN: This is a new number.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's 
              just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.</p>
            <p>PHONE MAN: Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of 
              experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze 
              of circular logic.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.</p>

            <p>KRAMER: Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you 
              know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?</p>
            <p>KRAMER (into phone): Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you 
              going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.</p>
            <p>Kramer gets up and Jerry grabs the phone from him.</p>

            <p>MAN: She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay. 
            </p>
            <p>JERRY: You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to 
              do.</p>
            <p>MAN: Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, 
              aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.</p>
            <p>MAN: You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?</p>
            <p>JERRY: What?</p>
            <p>MAN: Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get 
              my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her. </p>
            <p>JERRY: I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here. 
            </p>
            <p>MAN: Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent 
              contractor. Tax purposes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Elaine is sitting on her couch flipping through a magazine. She's 
              on the phone.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because 
              sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been 
              out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. 
              Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? 
              (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so 
              good. I think</p>
            <p>Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call 
              anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.</p>
            <p>Bobby dials 911.</p>
            <p>BOBBY: 9-1-1.</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Jerry is driving down the street when he sees Cindy walking on 
              the sidewalk.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.</p>
            <p>CINDY: What do you want?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Here. I got your money.</p>
            <p>CINDY: I don't want any money from you.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.</p>
            <p>A police cruiser pulls up with lights on.</p>
            <p>POLICE: Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the 
              car, sickie?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, this is all very sophisticated.</p>
            <p>INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Elaine is sitting on the sofa reading when there is a pounding 
              on the door. The door bursts open and some fire fighters run in.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>FIREMAN: All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it! </p>
            <p>ELAINE: Aah!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Kramer is waiting near a phone booth with a suitcase. A car pulls 
              up. It's Maxwell. </p>
            <p>MAXWELL: Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh, no.</p>
            <p>MAXWELL: You know where you're going?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I 
              don't know where he is.</p>
            <p>MAXWELL: Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh, no.</p>
            <p>MAXWELL: You wanna make some?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Ok.</p>
            <p>MAXWELL: Do you know how to use a mop wringer?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.</p>
            <p>MAXWELL: Why don't you get in the car?</p>
            <p>Kramer hops in.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.</p>
            <p>The two drive off.</p>
            <p>EXT. KRUGER'S OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Hey, Koko, Who's this?</p>
            <p>INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Everyone is gathered again around the conference table. George 
              is standing introducing the newest employee.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>GEORGE: This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, 
              to hire people?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yes?</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Ok, good enough for me, Koko.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>George sits down.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Ahem. Now, what's your name?</p>
            <p>COCO: My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Coco?</p>
<!-- BeginAd03 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>KRUGER: We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being 
              George.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, it was a hell of a ride.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the 
              front. How do we get it off?</p>
            <p>COCO: When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to 
              take a wet rag and in a circ--</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about 
              your Gammy.</p>
            <p>COCO: What did you say about my Gammy?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Forget Gammy.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Who's Gammy?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: There's no Gammy.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: Maybe there should be a Gammy.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh, no.</p>
            <p>KRUGER: George.</p>
            <p>ALL (chanting): Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! 
            </p>
            <p>GEORGE: Gammy's gettin' upset!</p>
