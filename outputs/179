      [Monologue, on stage]</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work.</p>
       
      <p>[Jerry and George at Monks]</p>
       
      <p>George: I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: I know what you mean.</p>
       
      <p>George: Do ya?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.</p>
       
      <p>George: Same thing!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.</p>
       
      <p>George: Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?</p>
       
      <p>Woman: What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?</p>
       
      <p>Man: It's up to you.</p>
       
      <p>Woman: You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?</p>
       
      <p>George: Nah - what for?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: To see a movie.</p>
       
      <p>George: I've been to the movies.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Not this movie.</p>
       
      <p>George: They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Did you shower today?</p>
       
      <p>George: Yeah.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.</p>
       
      <p>George: When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.</p>
       
      <p>George: Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick</p>
       
      <p>of health.</p>
       
      <p>Woman: All right, we're done. You can have it now.</p>
       
      <p>George: Oh, very gracious.</p>
       
      <p>[Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk. Kramer and Elaine drive up.]</p>
       
      <p>Man: Nice day</p>
       
      <p>George: Yeah.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: What is that?</p>
       
      <p>Kramer: Hey! JoJo!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Ey, ey!</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.</p>
       
      <p>Kramer: No, thank you. So what are you doing?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Nothing.</p>
       
      <p>Kramer: Come on, let's go to the beach.</p>
       
      <p>George: What are you crazy?</p>
       
      <p>Kramer: What? It's a beautiful day.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Have a good time.</p>
       
      <p>Kramer: Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?</p>
       
      <p>Kramer: Yeah, there's something in the air.</p>
       
      <p>[Kramer drives off]</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: What? No good?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Faux pas.</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: Faux pas?</p>
       
      <p>George: Big hefty stinking faux pas.</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: Why?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't
        want to take up any of my </p>
       
      <p>important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."</p>
       
      <p>George: On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.</p>
       
      <p>George: It's dismissive.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: It's pompous.</p>
       
      <p>George: Why don't you think before you do something?</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: Here's a thought - Bye bye.</p>
       
      <p>[Exit Elaine]</p>
       
      <p>George: Too much?</p>
       
      <p>[Jerry and George enter Jerry's apartment]</p>
       
      <p>George: Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Hey - hey - hey!</p>
       
      <p>George: What?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.</p>
       
      <p>George: You're so uptight.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.</p>
       
      <p>[Jerry listens to his answering machine]</p>
       
      <p>Phone Tape: Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at
        NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,</p>
       
      <p>definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.</p>
       
      <p>George: Who's he?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        "Jerry."</p>
       
      <p>George: Our show, "Jerry"?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Right.</p>
       
      <p>George: "Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?</p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
       
      <p>Jerry: Yeah!</p>
       
      <p>George: When? </p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Today, like right now.</p>
       
      <p>George: Right now? "Jerry"?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: "Jerry"!</p>
       
      <p>George: He wants to talk about "Jerry"?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: He wants to talk about "Jerry"!</p>
       
      <p>George: "Jerry"!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: "Jerry"!</p>
       
      <p>George: Can I go like this?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Sure!</p>
       
      <p>George: No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Forget the sports jacket.</p>
       
      <p>George: I won't feel like a writer.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: You're not a writer.</p>
       
      <p>George: Right!</p>
       
      <p>[Jerry and George are sitting in a waiting room at NBC]</p>
       
      <p>George: Water. Need some water! Water here!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.</p>
       
      <p>George: Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Don't blow this.</p>
       
      <p>George: I will not blow this.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.</p>
       
      <p>George: It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: He might not want nothing.</p>
       
      <p>George: Something, nothing, I could care less.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: He might want a show about anything and everything.</p>
       
      <p>George: Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: All right.</p>
       
      <p>Receptionist: Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you </p>
       
      <p>George: Magic time.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: What?</p>
       
      <p>[Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office]</p>
       
      <p>Receptionist: Mr. Kimbrough.</p>
       
      <p>Stu: Hey, Jerry, good to see you.</p>
       
      <p>George: Hey, hey, hey!</p>
       
      <p>Stu: How you been?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Good, good. You remember George.</p>
       
      <p>Stu: George, good to see you.</p>
       
      <p>George: Hello Stu.</p>
       
      <p>Stu: You remember Jay Crespi.</p>
       
      <p>George: Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?</p>
       
      <p>Stu: This is James Kimbrough.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.</p>
       
      <p>George: Kimbrough.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Don't spell.</p>
       
      <p>George: K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: That's right.</p>
       
      <p>George: It's a talent I have.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.</p>
       
      <p>George: Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Shut up, George.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Can I get you anything?</p>
       
      <p>George: What do we have in the fruit department?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Oy.</p>
       
      <p>Stu : Pineapple.</p>
       
      <p>George: Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from </p>
       
      <p>one of those things.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I
        reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.</p>
       
      <p>George: Been there, done that.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have
        people talking at the water coolers.</p>
       
      <p>George: Water coolers?</p>
       
      <p>Crespi: We call it a water-cooler show.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?</p>
       
      <p>George: See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than
        "coffee machine show."</p>
       
      <p>George: It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, "Jerry", that he
        developed five years ago.</p>
       
      <p>Stu: I have always loved it.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to
        tell you - I flipped out.</p>
       
      <p>Crespi: He totally flipped out.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off
        on Wednesday night, build up an</p>
       
      <p>audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: He's a little off the wall.</p>
       
      <p>Crespi: Oh yeah.</p>
       
      <p>Stu: Kramer.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Definitely.</p>
       
      <p>George: I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about.</p>
       
      <p>Kimbrough: Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?</p>
       
      <p>George: Or we could get them together. Woo!</p>
       
      <p>[George and Jerry attempt a hug outside Mr. Kimbrough's office]</p>
       
      <p>George: Yeah!</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Yeah!</p>
       
      <p>[Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news]</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. </p>
       
      <p>I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?</p>

      <p>Elaine: Jerry, I'm on the other line.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.</p>
       
      <p>Elaine: I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to

        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the

      <p>Deputy: Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000

        you have probably been </p>
       
      <p>discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking
        of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham,
        Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where
        Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-</p>

      <p>Rivera: And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they

        he told me quote "There's no love lost with that group."</p>
       
      <p>Rivera: Anything else, Jane?</p>
       
      <p>Wells: There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The
        rumor is that they once dated,</p>

      <p>Hoyt: Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two,
        passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human
        being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove,
        they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you
        one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in
        this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a
        history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how
        everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged,
        deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be
        held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will </p>
       
      <p>pay.</p>

      <p>Vandelay: Mr. Chiles.</p>
       
      <p>Chiles: I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous!
        It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these
        four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing -
        lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were
        innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because
        that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So
        how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander?
        No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition,
        innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They
        want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only
        you can stop them.</p>

        the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me,
        just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking,

        robbery.</p>
       
      <p>Wells: Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo,
        this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless
        parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four
        seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally

      <p>Wells: That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison
        invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that
        bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they
        sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just

      <p>Jerry: Yeah, maybe we have.</p>

      <p>[Epilogue, on stage in the prison]</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me
        to play in the yard. But of </p>
       
      <p>course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my
        thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that
        bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? </p>
       
      <p>You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock
        D?</p>
       
      <p>Prisoner 1: I am.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in
        Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?</p>
       
      <p>Prisoner 2: Murder one.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding
        sir - lighten up. How about </p>
       
      <p>you, what are you in for? </p>
       
      <p>Prisoner 3: Grand theft auto.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.</p>
       
      <p>Prisoner 3: You suck - I'm gonna cut you.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of
        your hand.</p>
       
      <p>Guard: Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.</p>
       
      <p>Jerry: Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.</p>
