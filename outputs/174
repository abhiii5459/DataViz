      INT. J. PETERMAN LUNCHROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Elaine and several co-workers stand around a table which has a 
              cake sitting on it.</p>
            <p>ALL (singing): Happy birthday to you. </p>
            <p>WALTER: Thanks.</p>
            <p>Everyone claps.</p>
            <p>FEMALE WORKER: Elaine, cake?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Uh, no, thanks.</p>
            <p>FEMALE WORKER: It's Walter's special day.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. 
              Every day is somebody's special day.</p>
            <p>Elaine takes a piece of cake and makes her way to the door, but 
              is stopped as a male worker carrying a cake enters.</p>
            <p>MALE WORKER: Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. 
              We have to celebrate.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: It's his birthday and it's his last day?</p>
            <p>MALE WORKER: This is other-Walter, from returns.</p>
            <p>Other-Walter enters followed by more co-workers.</p>
            <p>OTHER-WALTER: Hey, what's going on here?</p>
            <p>ALL: Surprise! </p>
            <p>OTHER-WALTER: Oh guys.</p>
            <p>Elaine tries to leave, but other-Walter stops her.</p>
            <p>OTHER-WALTER: Elaine, it's my last day. Have a piece.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: All right, pile it on.</p>
            <p>ALL (singing, competing): For he's a jolly good fellow...happy 
              birthday to you...for he's a jolly good fellow...birthday to you...which 
              nobody can deny...</p>
            <p>Elaine looks on frustrated.</p>
            <p>EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p>Jerry and Elaine stand in front of his stereo.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work 
              in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Why aren't you there now?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. 
              By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.</p>
            <p>They sit on the sofa.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee 
              messiness.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic 
              books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me 
              and George to Mario's Pizza?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Your old high school hangout? Why?</p>
            <p>JERRY: They're closing. We're going for one last slice.</p>
            <p>Kramer barges through the door holding a roll of yellow police 
              tape.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution 
              tape. Look at that. </p>
            <p>Jerry walks towards the counter where Kramer has placed some of 
              the tape.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Where did you get this?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.</p>
            <p>JERRY: You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any 
              of these people?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: They want to know why they never see you.</p>
            <p>Kramer ties a piece of tape around a banana.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: I'm gonna eat that later.</p>
            <p>JERRY: So they just gave you this?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room 
              for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this 
              new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running 
              around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.</p>
            <p>JERRY: How come I haven't read about this?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal 
              dissension about the name.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Really? What're the other titles?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Son of dad?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.</p>
            <p>EXT. MARIO'S PIZZA - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Mario's Pizza.</p>
            <p>INT. MARIO'S PIZZA - DAY</p>
            <p>George and Jerry admire their former hang out. Mario, an elder 
              man, stands behind the counter.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?</p>
            <p>MARIO: No.</p>
            <p>JERRY: We used to come in every day.</p>
            <p>MARIO: So where ya been? We're tanking here.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.</p>
            <p>MARIO: Oh, thanks. That'll save us.</p>
            <p>JERRY: All right, make it the large sodas.</p>
            <p>George and Jerry walk across the room.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this 
              game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.</p>
            <p>They walk over to watch a boy playing Frogger.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!</p>
            <p>The boy loses.</p>
            <p>BOY: Thanks a lot.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Ah, beat it, punk.</p>
            <p>The boy exits.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, look at the high score--&quot;G.L.C.&quot; George Louis 
              Costanza. That's not you, is it?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one 
              has beaten me in like 10 years.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I remember that night.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just 
              the right amount of grease on the joy stick...</p>
            <p>MARIO: Here's your pizza pea brains.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I think I remember why we stopped coming here.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Yeah.</p>
            <p>EXT. J PETERMAN BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Elaine is sitting at her desk smelling a pen.</p>
            <p>ELAINE (thinking): This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep 
              smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?</p>
            <p>There's a knock on the door and several co-workers enter with a 
              cake.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What is this?</p>
            <p>MALE WORKER: You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well 
              cake.</p>
            <p>FEMALE WORKER: It's carrot. It's good for you.</p>
            <p>WORKERS (singing): Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating 
              a sick day?</p>
            <p>MALE WORKER: I think it's nice.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life 
              with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. 
              Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow 
              metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!</p>
            <p>Another worker enters late.</p>
            <p>WORKER (singing): Get well, get well soon--</p>
            <p>MALE WORKER: It's not happening.</p>
            <p>They all start to leave disappointed.</p>
            <p>BECKY: Can we still it eat?</p>
            <p>EXT. MONK'S DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>INT. MONK'S DINER - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Jerry and Lisi sit at the usual booth.</p>
            <p>JERRY: I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--</p>
            <p>LISI: End under water?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--</p>
            <p>LISI: So much more violent.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Not as long.</p>
            <p>LISI: Well, I should probably--</p>
            <p>JERRY: Get going.</p>
            <p>LISI: Yeah.</p>
            <p>They both stand.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--</p>
            <p>LISI: Eight tomorrow?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Actually, that's--</p>
            <p>LISI: What you were thinking.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Right.</p>
            <p>Lisi leaves and Jerry goes to pay the cashier. George enters.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--</p>
            <p>JERRY: Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?</p>
            <p>They both sit down at their booth.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. 
              Now the torch will burn forever.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and 
              help me pick up the Frogger?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you 
              move it?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: What?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd 
              think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with 
              that score!</p>
            <p>George gets up and leaves in a huff.</p>
            <p>EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY- ESTABLISHING</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Well, more bad news Jerry.</p>
            <p>INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p>Kramer and Jerry are talking near the kitchen counter. George is 
              sitting at the table on Jerry's cordless phone. An open phone book 
              is in front of him.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper 
              in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.</p>
            <p>JERRYL Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the 
              city that look like me.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Not as many as there used to be.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that 
              I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. 
              H-hello?</p>
<!-- BeginAd01 --><!-- EndAd -->
            <p>Kramer peels and eats an orange.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician 
              like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can 
              do this.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Another friend?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't 
              even get along.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Well, is he good, Kramer?</p>
            <p>George gets up and walks towards Kramer.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Oh, he's the best...and the worst.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If 
              I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Slippery Pete?</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's 
              one of the things that we argue about.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must 
              live on!</p>
            <p>George grabs his coat and leaves the apartment. The phone rings. 
              Jerry tries to get by Kramer.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Come on.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.</p>
            <p>Jerry picks up the phone.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hello?</p>
            <p>INTERCUT:</p>
            <p>INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE/JERRY'S APARTMENT</p>
            <p>Elaine is on the phone and is smelling her tape dispenser.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: So how's it going with my friend?</p>
            <p>JERRY: She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.</p>
            <p>People can be heard singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in the background 
              of Elaine's office.</p>
            <p>JERRY: What is that?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't 
              realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.</p>
            <p>JERRY: So join in.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's 
              fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.</p>
            <p>JERRY: All right.</p>
            <p>Jerry hangs up and stands up to find some police tape around a 
              broken egg on the floor.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Hey, wh-what--</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.</p>

            <p>ELAINE: Anybody here? Peterboy?</p>
            <p>No one answers. She runs over to Peterman's fridge, opens it, and 
              takes out a box. She opens the box to find a cake.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Ooh, it's a cake walk.</p>
            <p>She takes a bite of the cake. Outside in the hallway, Mr. Peterman 
              can be heard singing.</p>

              well.</p>

              his office.</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, um--</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has 
              a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. 
              Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No, sir, I can't.</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest 
              acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII

            <p>GEORGE: So you slept with her?</p>
            <p>JERRY: She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the 
              Lopper, So I let her stay over.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: And you automatically sleep with her?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Finished your thought.</p>
            <p>George gets up and walks over to the sink. Elaine enters.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Guess what I ate.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: An ostrich burger.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke 
              Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.</p>
            <p>JERRY: How'd it taste?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: A little stale.</p>

            <p>GEORGE (nudges Elaine with his elbow): So, uh are you sleeping 
              with Peterman?</p>
            <p>ELAINE (nudges George with her elbow): No. He doesn't know I ate 
              it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even 
              it out.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more 
              of it.</p>
            <p>Jerry and Elaine start to walk from the counter towards the table.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise 
              for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship 
              weekend place.</p>
            <p>EALINE: What is going on with you two?</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her 
              the wrong message.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: What's that?</p>
            <p>Elaine opens up a paper bag and pulls out a cookie.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: 4:00 sugar fix.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, I'm calling this off right now. </p>

              is.</p>

              I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?</p>

            <p>LUBECK: No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's.</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Do they have a castle at Windsor?</p>
            <p>LUBECK: No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle.</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Oh, good lord.</p>
            <p>LUBECK: You all right, Peterman? You look ill.</p>
            <p>ELAINE (singing): Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. 
              Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY</p>
            <p>George and Jerry see Kramer, Shlomo, and Slippery Pete standing 
              outside Mario's Pizza. Slippery Pete is playing Frogger.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: What are you guys doing?</p>
            <p>SHLOMO: Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!</p>
            <p>GEORGE: You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.</p>
            <p>SLIPPERY PETE: The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 
              3 minutes left.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria</p>
            <p>KRAMER: George, they closed up.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: I need an outlet!</p>
            <p>SLIPPERY PETE: A what?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Holes! I need holes!</p>
            <p>KRAMER: The pharmacy's still open.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk 
              the pharmacist.</p>
            <p>Shlomo and Slippery Pete go to the pharmacy.</p>
            <p>SLIPPERY PETE (to George): You owe me a quarter.</p>
            <p>GEORGE (to Jerry): Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!</p>
            <p>Kramer ties the police tape to a tree and runs into traffic. He 
              runs out of tape before he can get halfway.</p>
            <p>KRAMER: Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!</p>
            <p>JERRY: Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of 
              something. I can do this.</p>
            <p>JERRY: By yourself?</p>
            <p>GEORGE: Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.</p>
            <p>George pushes the machine onto the street. From a view in the sky, 
              we see him dodging cars, hopping back and forth into lanes of traffic. 
              Frogger music and sound effects play.</p>
            <p>SHLOMO: He looks like a Frog.</p>
            <p>SLIPPERY PETE: So do you.</p>
            <p>George makes it across just as a huge truck comes barreling down 
              the street. George tries to get the Frogger onto the sidewalk, but 
              can't. He futilely sticks his hand out trying to stop the truck 
              which honks. George jumps out of the truck's way and onto the sidewalk 
              as the Frogger is smashed.</p>
            <p>JERRY: Game over.</p>
            <p>INT. J. PETERMAN'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Mr. Peterman sits in his chair behind his desk. Elaine knocks and 
              enters.</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I 
              was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the 
              books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.</p>
            <p>EALINE: Ohh...</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system 
              that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it 
              also caught this.</p>
            <p>Mr. Peterman shows Elaine the tape of her waltzing around the room 
              eating the cake.</p>
            <p>EALINE: Mr. Peterman, I, uh...</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with 
              you?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Um...as far as I know.</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after 
              six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?</p>
            <p>ELAINE: Uh, I guess I hadn't--</p>
            <p>PETERMAN: Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go 
              through is punishment enough. Dismissed.</p>
